--- 'Last Night' by Morgan Wallen ---
Last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night

I kiss your lips

Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips

Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth

Just talk about life goin' sip for sip

You, you know you love to fight

And I say shit I don't mean

But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me



I know that last night we let the liquor talk

I can't remember everything we said but we said it all

You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met

But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night

No way it was our last night



No way it was the last night that we break up

I see your tail lights in the dust

You call your momma, I call your bluff

In the middle of the night, pull it right back up

Yeah my, my friends say let her go

Your friends say what the hell

I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else



Oh baby, last night we let the liquor talk

I can't remember everything we said but we said it all

You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met

But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet



No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough

I can’t remember everything we said but we said too much

I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left

But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet

No way it was our last night

No way it was our last night



I know you said this time you really weren’t coming back again

But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet

No way it was our last night

No way it was our last night

--- 'Flowers' by Miley Cyrus ---
We were good, we were gold
Kind of dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Mmm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie

Started to cry, but then remembered I



I can buy myself flowers

Write my name in the sand

Talk to myself for hours

Say things you don't understand

I can take myself dancing

And I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than you can



Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby



Paint my nails cherry red

Match the roses that you left

No remorse, no regret

I forget every word you said



Ooh, I didn't wanna leave, baby, I didn't wanna fight

Started to cry, but then remembered I



I can buy myself flowers

Write my name in sand

Talk to myself for hours, yeah

Say things you don't understand

I can take myself dancing, yeah

I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than you can



Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, ooh, I



I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna fight

Started to cry, but then remembered I



I can buy myself flowers (Uh-huh)

Write my name in the sand (Ooh, mmm)

Talk to myself for hours (Yeah)

Say things you don't understand (Better than you)

I can take myself dancing (Yeah)

I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than

Yeah, I can love me better than you can



Can love me better, I can love me better, baby (Uh)

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby (Than you can)

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I

--- 'Kill Bill' by SZA ---
I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, now you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men I don't want

Nah, nah, just want you

If I can't have you, no one should



I might, I might kill my ex, not the best idea

His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?

I might kill my ex, I still love him though

Rather be in jail than alone



I get the sense that it's a lost cause

I get the sense that you might really love her

This text gon' be evidence

The text is evidence

I try to ration with you no morals or crimes of passion, but damn

You was out of reach

You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach

Now I'm in the basement, plan a home invasion

Now you lay your face down, got me sayin' over a beat



I'm so mature, I'm so mature

I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men I don't want

Nah, nah, just want you

If I can't have you, no one will



I might kill my ex, not the best idea

His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?

I might kill my ex, I still love him though

Rather be in jail than alone



I did it all for love (Love)

I did it all on no drugs (Drugs)

I did it all of this sober

I did it all for us, oh

I did it all for love (Love)

I did it all of this on no drugs (Drugs)

I did it all of this sober

Don't you know I did it all for us?



Oh, I just killed my ex, not the best idea

Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here?

I just killed my ex, I still love him though (I do)

Rather be in hell than alone

--- 'Creepin'' by Metro Boomin, the Weeknd and  Savage ---
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Just can't believe this, man)
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me

And I would never ask you

I just kept it to myself



I don't wanna know

If you're playin' me, keep it on the low

'Cause my heart can't take it anymore

And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show

Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-woah

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh



Oh, yeah

I think about it when I hold you

When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe

And I don't need to know the truth

Baby, keep it to yourself



I don't wanna know

If you're playin' me, keep it on the low

'Cause my heart can't take it anymore

And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show

Oh, baby, I don't wanna know



Did he touch you better than me? (Touch you better than me)

Did he watch you fall asleep? (Watch you fall asleep)

Did you show him all those things, that you used to do to me?

If you're better off that way (Better off that way)

There ain't more that I can say (More that I can say)

Just go on and do your thing and don't come back to me

Ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh



Woah, woah, woah, 21

Had me crushin', I was cuffin' like the precinct

How you go from housewife to a sneaky link?

Got you riding 'round in all type of Benzes and Rovers

Girl, you used to ride in the rinky dink

I'm the one put you in Eliantte (On God)

Fashion Nova model, I put you on the runway (On God)

You was rockin' coach bags, got you Chane'-ne'

Side bitch in Fresco, I call her my baby (21)

I got a girl but I still feel alone (On God)

If you playin' me that mean my home ain't home (On God)

Havin' nightmares of goin' through your phone (21)

Can't even record, you got me out my zone



I don't wanna know

If you're playin' me, keep it on the low

'Cause my heart can't take it anymore

And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show

Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

If you're playin' me, keep it on the low

'Cause my heart can't take it anymore

And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show

Oh, baby, I don't wanna know



If you creepin', just don't let me find out (On God)

Get a hotel, never bring 'em to the house (On God)

If you're better off that way

Baby, all that I can say

If you're gonna do your thing then don't come back to me

--- 'Fast Car' by Luke Combs ---
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose

Maybe we'll make something

Me, myself, I got nothing to prove



You got a fast car

And I got a plan to get us out of here

I've been working at the convenience store

Managed to save just a little bit of money

Won't have to drive too far

Just across the border and into the city

And you and I can both get jobs

Finally see what it means to be living



See, my old man's got a problem

He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is

He said his body's too old for working

His body's too young to look like his

So Mama went off and left him

She wanted more from life than he could give

I said, somebody's got to take care of him

So I quit school and that's what I did



You got a fast car

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?

Still gotta make a decision

Leave tonight or live and die this way



So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

City lights lay out before us

And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder

And I-I, had a feeling that I belonged

I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone



You got a fast car

We go cruising to entertain ourselves

You still ain't got a job

So I work in the market as a checkout girl

I know things will get better

You'll find work and I'll get promoted

And we'll move out of the shelter

Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs



So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

City lights lay out before us

And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder

And I-I, had a feeling that I belonged

I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone



You got a fast car

I got a job that pays all our bills

You stay out drinking late at the bar

See more of your friends than you do of your kids

I'd always hoped for better

Thought maybe together you and me would find it

I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere

Take your fast car and keep on driving



So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

City lights lay out before us

And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder

And I-I, had a feeling that I belonged

I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone



You got a fast car

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?

Still gotta make a decision

Leave tonight or live and die this way

--- 'Snooze' by SZA ---
Ooh, ooh-oh, oh, yeah
I think I know, woah, oh, oh, oh
I'd touch that fire for you
I'd do that three four times again, I'd testify for you
I'm told I like you that bitch I do

With all of them around you scared to do, I'm not

Long as you juggin' out here for me, I got it

My bands, schemin', new whip, I drop bodies

Long as you dreamin' 'bout me, ain't no problem

I don't got nobody, just with you right now

Tell the truth, I look better under you



I can't lose when I'm with you

How can I snooze and miss the moment?

You just too important

Nobody do body like you do

I can't lose when I'm with you

I can't just snooze and miss the moment

You just too important

Nobody do body like you do, you do



In a droptop ride with you, I feel like Scarface (Scarface)

Like that white bitch with the bob, I'll be your main one (Your main onе)

Let's take this argument back up to my placе (My place)

Sex remind you I'm not-violent, I'm your day one (Day one)

We ain't had shit, yeah, it was magic, yeah

Smash and grab shit, yeah

Nasty habits take a hold when you not here

Ain't a home when you not here

Hard to grow when you not here, I'm sayin'



I can't lose when I'm with you

How can I snooze and miss the moment?

You just too important

Nobody do body like you do

I can't lose when I'm with you

I can't just snooze and miss the moment

You just too important

Nobody do body like you do, you do



Been one hundred

How you frontin' on me and I'm the main one cryin'?

How you blame it on me and you the main one lyin'?

How you plannin' on leavin', I'm the main one cryin'?

Just tryna be your everything

Been one hundred

How you frontin' on me and I'm the main one cryin'?

How you blame it on me and you the main one lyin'?

How you plannin' on leavin', I'm the main one cryin'?



I can't lose when I'm with you

How can I snooze and miss the moment?

You just too important

Nobody do body like you do

I can't lose when I'm with you

How can I snooze and miss the moment?

You just too important

Nobody do body like you do, you do



Ah, ah, ah, ah

I think I know, woah, oh, oh, oh

See, no, I can lose

I think I know, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh, oh

Internet clones, got 'em kissin' through the phone

Pussies clickin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy

Nan' nigga seein' me, I'm young money CMB

I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB

The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND

I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD

I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ

I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing BNE

We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC

I layup with her for a couple days, then its BRB

You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did

When you know we did

She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit

Ayy, I'm livin every twenty-four like Kobe did

Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P to 8

Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake

Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate

Fifty-one division state patrollin' when it's late

21 my addy, so the knife is on the gate

All the dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate

Niggas see Drake and they underestimate

Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayy



Ah, ah

Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit

Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit

You is the man, you hear me?

--- 'As It Was' by Harry Styles ---
Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?

Nothin' to say

And everything gets in the way

Seems you cannot be replaced

And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh



In this world, it's just us

You know it's not the same as it was

In this world, it's just us

You know it's not the same as it was

As it was, as it was

You know it's not the same



Answer the phone

"Harry, you're no good alone

Why are you sitting at home on the floor?

What kind of pills are you on?"

Ringin' the bell

And nobody's coming to help

Your daddy lives by himself

He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh



In this world, it's just us

You know it's not the same as it was

In this world, it's just us

You know it's not the same as it was

As it was, as it was

You know it's not the same



Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet

I don't wanna talk about the way that it was

Leave America, two kids follow her

I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first



(Hey)

As it was

You know it's not the same as it was

As it was, as it was

--- 'Rock and a Hard Place' by Bailey Zimmerman ---
We've been swingin’ and missin'
It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixin’
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissin'
It's just different
We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together

Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we’re better

Off with all this, but we’re caught in-between



A rock and a hard place

Red wine and mistakes

Tears rollin' down your face

When I walked out that door

That’s when I lost it

Midnight in Austin

Damn, I'm exhausted

What the hell's this all for?

Is this where it mеnds or it breaks?

Between a rock and a hard place



For thе record (Shit)

Throwin' in the towel takes some effort

So I’d rather ride it out for better weather

Together



Between a rock and a hard place

Red wine and mistakes

Tears rollin' down your face

When I walked out that door

That's when I lost it

Midnight in Austin

Damn, I'm exhausted

What the hell's this all for?

Is this where it mends or it breaks?

Between a rock and a hard place



We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together

Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we're better

Off with all this, but we're caught in-between



A rock and a hard place

Tears rollin' down your face

As I walked out that door

That's when I lost it

Midnight in Austin

Damn, I'm exhausted

What the hell's this all for?

Is this where it mends or it breaks?

How much more of this can we take?

--- 'Cruel Summer' by Taylor Swift ---
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

--- 'Thinkin' Bout Me' by Morgan Wallen ---
Don't know where you at
Don't know where you been
Don't know nothin' 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame

Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind

How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing

You can curse my name but baby, don't you lie



When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?

When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missing my street?

Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?

When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?

Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your driveway was mine

It's like you know it's supposed to be

When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?

Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?

Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout

When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?



Do you hide your phone? Did you change my name?

When he wants to go to our go-to place

Do you tell him you came then go out of your way

To be somewhere, any damn where I ain't



When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?

When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missing my street?

Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?

When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?

Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your driveway was mine

It's like you know it's supposed to be

When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?

Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?

Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout

When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?



Don't know where you at

But girl, I know where you oughta be



When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?

When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missing my street?

Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?

When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?

Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your driveway was mine

It's like you know it's supposed to be

Yeah, I'm on the stage right now
Singin' your favorite song
Look in the crowd
And you're nowhere to be found as they sing along
I say you look good without no makeup
No lashes, even better when you wake up

Uh-uh-uh

I see the look on your face

I see you hidin' the hate

I see you lookin' for someone to scoop you right off of your feet

You wanna ride in a Wraith

You wanna go out on dates

You want somebody to come bring you flowers

Someone to talk to for hours

Wash your back while y'all sit in the shower, yeah

Someone to tell you, "You're beautiful"

Someone to tell you and mean it

Someone to tell you, "I love you" every day

And don't got a reason

You want someone to bring you peace, uh

Someone to help you sleep, yeah

Someone to pick you up when you're feelin' down, feelin' lonely

Need somebody who can make it better

Somebody who can open up those gates

Open up those gates to your heart

Only if you'll let me

Something just dawned on me
I ain't been home in some months
Been chasin' songs and women
Makin' some bad decisions
God knows I'm drinkin' too much

Yeah, I know you've been worrying 'bout me

You've been losin' sleep since '93



I thought you should know

That all those prayers you thought you wasted on me

Must've finally made their way on through

I thought you should know

I got me a new girl down in Jefferson City, and

She lets me fish whenever I want to

Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from

Still your only damn son

Can you believe I'm on the radio?

Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know



Oh, by the way, Momma, didn't mean to ramble on ya

How's everything back at home?

Yeah, how's that garden comin'?

Is dad still doing dumb shit?

And how'd he keep you this long?

Yeah, I'm sorry that I called you so late

I just miss you but anyways



I thought you should know

That all those prayers you thought you wasted on me

Must've finally made their way on through

I thought you should know

I got me a new girl down in Jefferson City, and

She lets me fish whenever I want to

Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from

Still your only damn son

Can you believe I'm on the radio?

Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know

Yeah, I know you've been worrying 'bout me

You've been losing sleep since '93

I thought you should know

That all those prayers you thought you wasted on me

Must've finally made their way on through



I thought you should know

That I really like this girl down in Jefferson City, and

It turns out she's a lot like you

Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from

Still your only damn son

The bus is leavin' so I gotta roll

Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know

I thought you should know, thought you should know

I thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know

I was lost, you found a way to bring me back
Needed forgiveness
You always gave me that
Girl, I'm a witness of your love 'cause you don't be giving up
And it's crazy
How you saved me



Hand on the Bible

Don't know how I got you

But I couldn't ask for more

Girl, what we got's worth thanking God for



So, thank God

I get to wake up by your side and thank God

Your hand fits perfectly in mine and thank God

You loved me when you didn't have to

But you did and you do and He knew

Thank God for giving me you

Oh, yeah, thank God

Thank God for giving me you (Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah)



Never thought I'd find an angel undercover

Made a change to everything

From my heart to my last name

Hey, hard to tell when he fell

That boy was Heaven sent

And every night when I close my eyes

Before I say Amen



I thank God

I get to wake up by your side and thank God

Your hand fits perfectly in mine and thank God

You loved me when you didn't have to

But you did and you do and He knew

Thank God for giving me you, thank God

Thank God, yeah, yeah

Thank God, ooh

Treat you like a friend

Respect you like a lover

--- 'All My Life' by Lil Durk featuring J. Cole ---
Durkio told me he been on some positive shit, yeah, yeah
Lately, I just wanna show up and body some shit, yeah, yeah
Always been a lil' mathematician, lately, it's cash I'm gettin'
Got me losin' count of these bags, I've been movin' too fast
Hard times don't last, 'member when cops harassed
Talkin' out my ass, boy, you ain't shit but a bitch with a badge



All my life (All my life)

They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)

All this time (All this time)

Never thought I would make it out (Never thought I'd make it out)

They couldn't break me, they couldn't break mе (No, no)

They couldn't take me, thеy couldn't take me (No)

All my life (All my life)

They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)



I decided I had to finish

But the media called me a menace

I done sat with the mayor and politicians, I'm tryna change the image

You can't blame my past no more, I come from the trenches

Some said I'd never be a superstar, but I know I'm different (No, no, no)

I'm The Voice, but the system ain't give me a choice

Know some people that's still unemployed

I know a felon who tryna get FOID

Child support your only support

For a visit, I'm goin' through courts

Went to jail, they was chainin' me up

And you know that I'm famous as fuck

See how you gon' joke about stimulus?

But they really had came in the clutch

I know some kids wanna hurt theyself

Stop tryna take drugs, I refer to myself

Tryna better myself, tryna better my health but



All my life (All my life)

They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)

All this time (All this time)

Never thought I would make it out (Never thought I'd make it out)

They couldn't break me, they couldn't break me (No, no)

They couldn't take me, they couldn't take me (No)

All my life (All my life)

They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down, yeah)



First-generation ghetto nigga

Cole world, hello niggas

Made it out the city with my head on straight

Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out

Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out

And the shit that I spit out

Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO

And how a nigga put a hit out

And another one, and, and another one

I got like a hundred of 'em

'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me

But I'm really in front of them

Now some of them fumblin' they bags

Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had

A reminder to humble yourself

This shit could be gone in an instant

Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'

I been stuck between maybe retirin'

And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime

These days seein' rappers be dyin'

Way before they even gettin' they shine

I never even heard of lil' buddy

'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy

Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name

Got to playin' his tunes

All day in my room, thinkin', "Damn

This shit wicked, to get they name buzzin'

Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb"

And media thirsty for clicks

I got a new rule

If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive

You can't post about him after he get hit

It's simple, it's the principle

On any tempo, I'm invincible

Don't even rap, I just vent to you

I rather that than an interview most days

Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase

Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage

I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid

And the only thing that kill 'em is old age



All my life (All my life)

They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)

All this time (All this time)

Never thought I would make it out (Never thought I'd make it out)

They couldn't break me, they couldn't break me (No, no)

They couldn't take me, they couldn't take me (No)

All my life (All my life)

They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)

--- 'Ella Baila Sola' by Eslabon Armado and Peso Pluma ---
Compa, ¿qué le parece esa morra?
La que anda bailando sola me gusta pa' mí
¡Bella! Ella sabe que está buena
Que todos andan mirándola cómo baila
Me acerco y le tiro todo un verbo
Tomamos tragos sin peros, solo tentación

Le dije: "Voy a conquistar tu familia, que en unos días vas a ser mía"

Me dijo que estoy muy loco, pero le gusta

Que ningún vato como yo actúa



Y ahí te va, mija

Y pura Doble P, viejo

Así nomás, compa Pedro

Puro Eslabon Armado

Pa' las plebitas

¡Cha-chau!



No soy un vato que tiene varo

Pero hablando del corazón te cumplo todo

Me agarró pegadito dе su mano

Mi compa ni se la creyó, que al pasar fui yo

Su cuеrpo, juro por Dios, que era tan perfecta

Su cinturita como modelo

Sus ojos desde el principio me enamoraron

A ella le gusto y a mí me gusta

--- 'Vampire' by Olivia Rodrigo ---
Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise

I loved you truly

You gotta laugh at the stupidity



'Cause I've made some real big mistakes

But you make the worst one look fine

I should've known it was strange

You only come out at night

I used to think I was smart

But you made me look so naïve

The way you sold me for parts

As you sunk your teeth into me, oh

Bloodsucker, famefucker

Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire



And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news

You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too

You're so convincing

How do you lie without flinching?

(How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)

Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill

Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will

Went for me and not her

'Cause girls your age know better



I've made some real big mistakes

But you make the worst one look fine

I should've known it was strange

You only come out at night

I used to think I was smart

But you made me look so naïve

The way you sold me for parts

As you sunk your teeth into me, oh

Bloodsucker, famefucker

Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire



(Ah)

You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?

You can't love anyone 'cause that could mean you had a heart

I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't

'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand



I've made some real big mistakes

But you make the worst one look fine

I should've known it was strange

You only come out at night

I used to think I was smart

But you made me look so naïve

The way you sold me for parts

As you sunk your teeth into me, oh

Bloodsucker, famefucker

Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire

Fuck you mean?
Young Gunna Wunna back, callin' me splurge
Watch me jump right off the curb
Bentley Spur fly like a bird

Spin on the first and the third

Solid, I'm keepin' my word

Can't be my equal, I don't know what you heard

Crank up the foreign, I swerve

Keep me a stick if they purge



Ha, ha, ha, ha

Ha, ha, ha, ha



Fuck you mean?

Young Gunna Wunna, they workin' my nerves

I'm about to pour up some syrup

Fucking this bitch like a perv'

Smack from the back, grab her perm

Ice, the burr, uh, shittin' on all you lil' turds

Can't take that dick, wait your turn

In my own lane, we can't merge

Suck with no hands, you can learn

Let's see how much you can earn

Watch me go big like thе Worm

And I ain't smokin' no sherm

I'm in this bitch with P Litty

QP, QP-ski

All of my bitches is pretty, thеy showin' they titties, it's up to the ceilin'

I let her run through a million, I rock with her really, let's fuck on a billion

I'ma get down to the gritty, then fuck up the city, the home of the villains

Ecstasy, wonderful feelin'

Smoke out the pound when I'm chillin'

Trappin', I made me a killin'

Look, I got everybody wishin'

I hope you play your position

I don't want nobody listenin'

I see the ho with precision

Get rich my only decision



Fuck you mean?

Young Gunna Wunna back, callin' me splurge

Watch me jump right off the curb

Bentley Spur fly like a bird

Spin on the first and the third

Solid, I'm keepin' my word

Can't be my equal, I don't know what you heard

Crank up the foreign, I swerve

Keep me a stick if they purge



Fuck you mean?

Fuck you mean?

Yeah

Yeah

--- 'Lavender Haze' by Taylor Swift ---
Meet me at midnight
Oooh oooh oooh woah
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into

My melancholia



I've been under scrutiny (yeah oh yeah)

You handle it beautifully (yeah oh yeah)

All this shit is new to me (yeah oh yeah)



I feel a lavender haze creeping up on me

So real

I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say

No deal

The 1950s shit they want for me



I just wanna stay in the lavender haze

Oooh oooh oooh woah



All they keep asking me (all they keep asking me)

Is if I'm gonna be your bride

The only kind of girl they see (The only kind of girl they see)

Is a one night or a wife



I find it dizzying (yeah oh yeah)

They're bringing up my history (yeah oh yeah)

But you aren't even listening (yeah oh yeah)



I feel a lavender haze creeping up on me

So real

I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say

No deal

The 1950s shit they want for me



I just wanna stay in the lavender haze (Oooh Oooh Oooh Woah)

The lavender haze

Talking, talking, go viral

I just need this love spiral



Get it off your chest

Get it off my desk

Talking, talking, go viral

I just need this love spiral

Get it off your chest

Get it off my desk



I feel a lavender haze creeping up on me

So real

I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say

No deal

Shit they want for me

I just wanna stay in the lavender haze



Oooh oooh oooh woah

Get it off your chest

Get it off my desk

The lavender haze

I just wanna stay

I just wanna stay

In that lavender haze

--- 'Need a Favor' by Jelly Roll ---
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So, who the hell am I, who the hell am I
To expect a Savior o-o-oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor
God I need a favor!



I know Amazing Grace, but I ain't been livin' them words

Swear I spend most Sundays, drunk off my ass, than I have in church

Hard cover King James only been savin' dust on the nightstand

And I don't know what to say by the time I fold my hands



I only talk to God when I need a favor

And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer

So, who the hell am I, who the hell am I

To expect a Savior o-o-oh

If I only talk to God when I need a favor

God I need a favor

Amen. Amen.



Yeah, I owe you more than one, and beggars can't be choosers

But I'll pay for all I've done, just please don't let me lose her



I only talk to God when I need a favor

And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer

So, who the hell am I, who the hell am I

To expect a Savior o-o-oh

If I only talk to God when I need a favor

God I need a favor

Amen. Amen.

Amen. Amen.



Hangin' in there, just barely

Throwin' up prayers, like Hail Mary's

If he's still there, Lord spare me

Oh my God, oh my God - Hail Mary



Hangin' in there, just barely

Throwin' up prayers, like Hail Mary's

If he's still there, Lord spare me

Oh my God, oh my God - Hail Mary



I only talk to God when I need a favor

And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer

So tell me, who the hell am I to expect a Savior

When I only talk to God when I need a favor

God I need a favor. Amen.

God I need a favor. Amen.

--- 'Dance the Night' by Dua Lipa ---
Baby, you can find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up, don't you wanna just
Come along for the ride?
Ooh, my outfit so tight
You can see my heartbeat tonight

I can take the heat, baby, best believe

That's the moment I shine



'Cause every romance shakes and it bends

Don't give a damn

When the night's here, I don't do tears

Baby, no chance



I could dance, I could dance, I could dance



Watch me dance, dance the night away

My hеart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face

Watch me dancе, dance the night away (Uh-huh)

I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place



Lately, I been movin' close to the edge

Still be lookin' my best

I stay on the beat, you can count on me

I ain't missin' no steps



'Cause every romance shakes and it bends

Don't give a damn

When the night's here, I don't do tears

Baby, no chance



I could dance, I could dance, I could dance



Watch me dance, dance the night away

My heart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face

Watch me dance, dance the night away (Uh-huh)

I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place



When my heart breaks (They never see it, never see it)

When my world shakes (I feel alive, I feel alive)

I don't play safe (Ooh), don't you know about me? (Uh-huh)

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance



Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face

I'll still keep the party goin', not one hair out of place (Yes, I can)

Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face (Yes, I can, yes, I can)

I'll still keep the party goin', not one hair out of place

--- 'Love You Anyway' by Luke Combs ---
If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in Ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I'd be in pieces trying to make the breaking last
If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes



There's just some things that leave a man no choice

Like a compass needle needing its true north

Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks

Oh, I'd love you anyway



I know just tryin' to write a song

I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong

And well I guess what I'm tryin' to say

Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

And if you turned your back on me and walked away

Not a thing about the way I feel would change



There's just some things that leave a man no choice

Like a compass needle needing its true north

Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks

Oh, I'd love you anyway



There's just some things that leave a man no choice

Like a compass needle needing its true north

Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks

Oh, I'd love you anyway



Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks

Oh, I'd love you anyway

--- 'One Thing at a Time' by Morgan Wallen ---
Somebody hand me a cigarette
I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been gettin' better by the day but tonight I drink
You say I gotta get over you and get sober too

I got a lot of habits I gotta kick

But weigh out all your options and take your pick



I can either burn the bar down

Or I can take your number out my phone

I can give you up right now

And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned

If you want me to quit you, want me to get you

Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind

I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time



I know I got me some problems

About a thousand memories I gotta forgеt

But if I'm gonna solve 'em

Baby, I'lI take all thе help I can get



If you ain't gonna kiss me

Then I'lI take some whiskey, some Grizzly

Nicotine amphetamines too

You want me to stop some of that

Or you want me to stop lovin' you?

Hey, what you want me to do?



I can either burn the bar down

Or I can take your number out my phone

I can give you up right now

And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned

If you want me to quit you, want me to get you

Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind

I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time



Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you

Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you



I ain't no superman, I'm just the way I am

If I'm gonna move on, then I need me somethin' in my hand

Ain't nothin' wrong with that

And if you ain't comin' back



I can either burn the bar down

Or I can take your number out my phone

I can give you up right now

And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned

If you want me to quit you, want me to get you

Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind

I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time



Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you

Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you

Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you

Drinking dope turned me to a superhero, yeah, yeah
Hit that pill, turned me to a superhero, yeah, Super
Boominati turned me to a superhero, yeah (Metro)

(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)



I'm on that dope again, I'm on that flow again

Switched up the flow again, yeah, yeah (Switch it)

Flyer than a parachute, grippin' that pole again

I'm on that oil again, yeah, yeah



Candy in the cup, gotta get paid (What?)

King of the streets, young nigga made

Spraying up the crowd, take it to the gravе

Ain't having problems, I'm sipping the Barre

Shoutout to Dallas, my bitch is a star

Nigga gеt rich, better take it to war

Piss on your casket, shoot at your broad

Do you something nasty, roll you in a 'gar

Bitch get graphic, fuck me in a car

I get you a brand new Rollie tomorrow

I put that brand new Rollie on your arm

Ain't moving slow when I'm skrrting on oil

Tennis bracelets and they came with the frost

Cuban links all the way up to your jaw

Step up the swag when I step on a broad



Two and a half, ooh, that's the cheapest one

Been stacking these hundreds up, like coupons

Told you for now never again, upper echelon

I get to stacking up, I'm untouchable

I get to represent, money multiple

When I'm at the top of the charts, unapproachable

Bread by the loaf, turbo the motor

Tic-Tac-Toe, kill another vulture

Selling them bowls, bitch do yoga

I deserve an award, serving these boulders

A hundred grand large when I shop, that's the total

Fill up the garage, bitch, I'm a mogul

Ain't no facade, ain't no fugazi

I jump it off, I get paid

Drop top Royce, I'm going crazy

I push off, smoking on haze

Not tryna floss, Cartier shades



Candy in the cup, gotta get paid (What?)

King of the streets, young nigga made

Spraying up the crowd, take it to the grave

Ain't having problems, I'm sipping the Barre

Shoutout to Dallas, my bitch is a star

Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero

Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain

Soon as you up, these niggas wanna bring you down

The weight of the world sit on my shoulders, hold the crown

I ain't got a cape so I can't save you now

Niggas wanna hate (Yeah) they'd rather see you drown (Yeah)

And the world keep spinnin'

Like I'm the only one in it (Am I the only one? Why?)

They don't wanna see you winnin' (No, no, no, no)

So who's really the villain? (Yeah, ooh)

Who's the villain? Who's the villain?

Live long enough to see yourself become a villain

What you, ooh, uh, what you do?
Made a move, coulda made a move

If I knew I'd be with you

Is it too late to pursue?



I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit

Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it

Thought you were too good for me, my dear

Never gave me time of day, my dear

It's okay, things happen for

Reasons that I think are sure, yeah



I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me (I wish I knew)

I wish I knew (Yeah), I wish I knew you wanted me (Oh)

Please say to me (Please, just say to me)

If you still wanna

I wish you wouldn't play with me

I wanna know (Oh, no)



Uh, can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?

Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?

No, you're not too good for me, my dear

Funny you come back to me, my dear

Reasons that I can't ignore, yeah

--- 'La Bebé' by Yng Lvcas and Peso Pluma ---
Hoy es noche de estar soltera
Le gusta el perreo y bailar de cerca
Me encanta cuando bellaquea
Quiere que la toque, pe-ro sabes ti
Que esta noche estás pa' mí
Ven, trépate encima 'e mí, manda la ubi', paso por ti

Quiere que le ponga música

Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé (la bebé, la bebé)

Bebimos un par de botellas

Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer

Quiere que le ponga música

Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé (la bebé, la bebé)

Bebimos un par de botellas

Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer

No se le ha olvidado cómo la pasamos

Fuimos a la disco y los dos bailamos pegados

Como perros pegaos, besos y par de tragos

Se quedó a mi lado y dijo: "creo me he enamorado"

Ella fuma, ella toma

Es diablita, chiquita, pero picosa

Me encanta cuando el pantalón me lo rosa

A ella le encanta, se ve en su cara lo goza

Tiene novio y no se comporta

Me dice: "tranqui, que la relación 'ta rota"

Nuestros cuerpos chocan y chocan

Se juntan las bocas, los leggings le ahorcan

Quiere que le ponga música

Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé (la bebé, la bebé)

Bebimos un par de botellas

Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer

Quiere que le ponga música

Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé (la bebé, la bebé)

Bebimos un par de botellas

Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer, ayer, ayer

Y te movias muy bien, muy bien

Y se impregnó el olor de Chanel

Tamos 1000 grados farenheit

Está buena y de cara bonita

Le pones música y solita se excita

Pa' la fiesta nunca se limita

Par de amigas, completa la cuadrilla

Pero tú, mamá, sabes, me mamas

Loca, ven pa'cá, pégate hasta atrás

Nos vamos tú y yo en un viaje fugaz

Interestellar, comerte toda

Fumaremos los dos marihuana

En el cuarto, en la azotea y en mi cama

Nena, creo te llaman, contesta mañana

Que no se apague la flama

Llama a los bomberos, que el cuarto se va a incendiar

De tanto calor creo que nos vamos a desmayar

Chica, ven pa'cá, que te voy a bellaquear

Ojitos chinitos como dice Don Omar

La bebé, la bebé

Y hasta abajo la bebé

Hasta abajo la bebé

Hasta abajo la bebé

Hasta abajo la bebé-bé-bé-bé

Quiere que le ponga música

Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé (la bebé, la bebé)

Bebimos un par de botellas

Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer

Quiere que le ponga música

Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé (la bebé, la bebé)

Bebimos un par de botellas

Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer

--- 'Golden Hour' by Jvke ---
It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, "Where you at tonight?"
Got no alibi, I was all alone



With the love of my life

She's got glitter for skin

My radiant beam in the night

I don't need no light to see you



Shine

It's your golden hour

You slow down time

In your golden hour



We were just two lovers

Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer

Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power

Minutes feel like hours

She knew she was the baddest

Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?



For the love of my life

She's got glow on her face

A glorious look in her eyes

My angel of light



I was all alone with the love of my life

She's got glitter for skin

My radiant beam in the night

I don't need no light to see you



Shine

It's your golden hour

You slow down time

In your golden hour

--- 'Religiously' by Bailey Zimmerman ---
I went looking at pictures I didn't wanna see, they brought back memories
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted but it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care, it's been a couple years and yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken up hearts but I only shed real tears over ours
Now I'm in this cold bright light

And this don't even feel like life

'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me

Religiously (Religiously)

And now I'm in the back of the church

Praying just to stop the hurt

'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me

Religiously (Religiously)



Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar, I thought I'd marry you

Act like I'm happier now but all of my friends know that ain't the truth

And lately life's been good to me

Momma's healthy and I'm helpin' out the whole family

A lot of people know my name, I made a little change

But that don't mean nothin'



'Cause now I'm in this cold bright light

And this don't even feel like life

'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me

Religiously (Religiously)

And now I'm in the back of the church

Praying hard just to stop the hurt

'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me

Religiously (Religiously)



You brought me to God and I put you through Hell

You were all about us, I was all about myself

What kind of man would lose a woman like that?

If my soul could be forgiven, I would give it all back



Now I'm in this cold bright light

And this don't even feel like life

'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me

Religiously

And now I'm in the back of the church

Begging God just to stop the hurt

'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me

Religiously (Religiously)

I ain't got the only woman who was there for me

Religiously

You gotta motherfuckin' feel this shit, boy
(BanBwoi)
Woah
I got feelings for you
Hope you ain't lovin' the crew

How many bodies you got?

Pray it ain't more than a few

Know that you dealt with some lames

When you was young and in school

He had to pop your cherry

But I got it wet like a pool

She got a new G-Wag'

She wanna hit Highlight Room and show it off

Got a new body, girl, show it off

This a Brazilian, I know it's soft

Toned up and she got a six-pack

Look like she used to play volleyball

American Express, you can have it all

Code to the safe, you can have it all

Fuck your main page, what's your Finsta? I wanna know the real you

You started dancin' to pay your tuition, girl, I wanna know what you been through

You want a boutique or you wanna sell hair, just let me know what you into

If you out in public and he want your number, just tеll him, "My nigga'll spin you"



The way you make me feel thеse days

Somethin' gettin' dropped for you, baby girl

Smoke a nigga top for you, baby girl

Burn somebody block for you

The way you make me feel these days

Comin' out my body for you, baby girl

Wipe him like he snotty for you, baby girl

Comin' out my body for you



Damn, just turned on the news and seen that men who never got pussy in school

Are makin' laws about what women can do

I gotta protect ya, I'm a made man, tied in, all the way, baby

So I gotta respect ya

Niggas put hands on you in the past, insecure because your body is pressure

Four words when I think about them is crusty, musty, dusty, rusty

Eight words when I think about us is fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me

Disrespect ya and I'll smack 'em

The texts that you send in captions

The videos we got ever leak, we goin' viral or goin' platinum

Don't worry 'bout your friend's story when I had her alone

She gon' try and put some extras on it, take you out of your zone

You know how it goes when they can't get a reservation up in Carbone

They gon' tell you it's a chill night, tell you how they'd rather stay home, yeah

Jealous-ass hoes, yeah

And I know what I said 'bout bein' in Vogue

But just like that R&B group from the '90s

Girl, one call, I'll get you in Vogue

One call, you in runway shows

One call, I'm sittin' front row

One wrong call from your ex nigga sayin' dumb shit'll get him sent home

One call and my niggas ten toes

Down to go wherever I say go

Even if we gotta travel 'cross the globe

Down to take you to the end of the road, for real



The way you make me feel these days

Somethin' gettin' dropped for you, baby girl

Smoke a nigga top for you, baby girl

Burn somebody block for you

The way you make me feel these days

Comin' out my body for you, baby girl

Wipe him like he snotty for you, baby girl

Comin' out my body for you



Want ya, I want-want ya

Oh, your lovin' so deep (Feelin' so deep)

Want ya, I want-want ya

Give me your lovin' (Feelin' so deep)

--- 'Next Thing You Know' by Jordan Davis ---
You swear that you're stayin' single
Next thing you know
You meet a girl at a bar
And next thing you know
You get her laughin'
It's 2 AM

You're telling your buddies

3 months in



That she ain't movin' in

Next thing you know

There's a U-Haul trailer

Next thing you know

Your old apartment

Is y'all's new place

There goes the carpet

But the deer head stays



Next thing you know

You're savin' money like never before, just to

Spend it all at a jewelry store, gettin'

Down on one knee on her mama's porch

Just prayin' she don't say no

Next thing you know

Your best man gives a half-drunk speech and you're

Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and you're

Left hand's gettin' used to that ring

And there the next two or three years go

Next thing you know



You weren't really tryin'

Next thing you know

There's a test on the counter

Next thing you know

She's standin' there cryin'

Noddin' her head yes

You're half excited

Half scared to death



'Cause next thing you know

You're wearing scrubs and a funny white hat and the

Doctor's sayin', how you doin' there dad and

Nobody's ever called you that

And you take that drive home slow

Next thing you know

It's first steps, first dates, first car, it's

11:01 wonderin' where they are

You're sayin' that USC's too far

It's amazing how fast 17 years go

Next thing you know

Next thing you know



Next thing you know

You get to know your wife again and you're

More in love than you've ever been with a

Lot of years of remember when's

And still some down the road

'Cause next thing you know

You got a yard full of your kid's kids and ya

Take 'em to church, teach 'em to fish, and ya

Tell 'em stories every chance you get

About how fast this life down here can go

Next thing you know

(Next thing you know)

Next thing you know

(Next thing you know)

--- 'Escapism' by Raye featuring  Shake ---
Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or somethin'
I ordered two more wines, 'cause tonight I want him
A little context if you care to listen

I find myself in this shit position

The man that I love sat me down last night

And he told me that it's over, dumb decision

And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'

Fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'

And I'm out on the town with a simple mission

In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'



Just a heart broke bitch

High heels six inch

In the back of the nightclub, sipping champagne

I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with

In the back of the taxi sniffing cocaine

Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex

I was looking for a man who's on the same page

Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar

To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways



'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night

I don't wanna feel how I did last night

Doctor, doctor, anything, please

Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me

Take this pain away

You're asking me my symptoms, doctor

I don't wanna feel



Toke this joint how I'm blowing this steam

Back to my ways like 2019

Not 24 hours since my ex did dead it

I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty

Last night really was the cherry on the cake

Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'

Excuse my state

I'm as high as your hopes that you'll make it on my bed

Get me hot and sizzlin'

If I take a step back to see the glass half full

At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in

And I'm already actin' like a dick

Know what I mean?

So you might as well stick it in



Just a heart broke bitch

High heels six inch

In the back of the nightclub, sipping champagne

I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with

In the back of the taxi sniffing cocaine

Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex

I was looking for a man who's on the same page

Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar

To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways



'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night

I don't wanna feel how I did last night

Doctor, doctor, anything, please

Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me

Take this pain away

You're asking me my symptoms, doctor

I don't wanna feel (What?)



'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night

I don't wanna feel like I felt last night

Be at peace with the things you can't change

I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah

Out of reach, out of touch, too numb, I don't feel no way

Toast up, so what, street small but it go both ways

So, you'll run, but you'll never escape

Sunset in the maze

(You're asking me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel)



I don't wanna feel how I did last night

I don't wanna feel how I did last night, oh

Doctor, doctor, anything, please

Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me

You're asking me my symptoms, doctor

I don't wanna feel



I don't wanna feel how I did last night

I don't wanna feel how I did last night



Lipstick smudged like modern art

I don't know where the fuck I am

Or who's driving the fucking car

Speeding down the highway sippin'

Mixing pills with the liquor

'Cause fuck these feelings

I left everyone I love on read (Uh-uh)

Spilling secrets to the stranger in my bed (Uh-uh)

I remember nothing so there's nothing to regret (Uh-uh)

Other than this 4/4 kick drum poundin' in my head (Hm)

--- 'Until I Found You' by Stephen Sanchez ---
Georgia, wrap me up in all your...
I want you, in my arms
Oh, let me hold you
I'll never let you go again, like I did
Oh, I used to say

"I would never fall in love again, until I found her"

I said, "I would never fall, unless it's you I fall into"

I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her

I found you



Georgia, pulled me in, I asked to...

Love her, once again

You fell, I caught you

I'll never let you go again, like I did

Oh, I used to say



"I would never fall in love again, until I found her"

I said, "I would never fall, unless it's you I fall into"

I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her

I found you

Still don't know my worth

Still stressin' perfection

Let you all in my mental

Got me lookin' too desperate

Damn (You ain't deserve)



Broad day, sunshine

I'll find a way to fuck it up still

Can't cry about the shit that I can't change

Gotta get outta here

Tough crowd, hate it

Can't stay

Feelin' lost, but I like it

Comfort in my sins and all about me

--- 'Wait in the Truck' by Hardy featuring Lainey Wilson ---
I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Working my way through a middle-of-June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was something in the headlights
It stopped me on a dime

Well, she was scared to death, so I said

"Climb in, " and then she climbed

Oh, yeah

Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe

With a tear in her blood-stained shirt

She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to

I knew what had happened to her

I didn't load her down with questions

That girl had been through enough

I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes

And I asked her where he was

I don't know if he's an angel

'Cause angels don't do what he did

He was hellbent to find the man behind

All the whiskey scars I hid

I never thought my day of justice

Would come from a judge under a seat

But I knew right then I'd never get hit again

When he said to me

"Wait in the truck

Just wait in the truck"

Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came

So I kicked in his double-wide door

I let the hammer drop before he got

To that 12 he was reaching for

I didn't try to hide my pistol

I didn't even try to run

I just sat on the porch, smoking one of his cigarettes

And waited for the cops to come

I don't know if he's an angel

'Cause angels don't do what he did

He was hellbent to find the man behind

All the whiskey scars I hid

I never thought my day of justice

Would come from a judge under a seat

But I knew right then I'd never get hit again

When he said to me

"Wait in the truck

Just wait in the truck"

Whoa (whoa)

Have mercy on me, Lord

Have mercy on me

Have mercy on me (hey), Lord

It's been 60 months and she still comes

To see me from time to time

It was worth the price, to see a brighter side

Of the girl I picked up that night

And I might be here forever

It ain't paradise, that's true

But it's whole hell of a lot better

Than the place I sent him to, yeah

Wait in the truck (have mercy on me)

Just wait in the truck

(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me)

Wait in the truck (Lord, have mercy)

Just wait in the truck

have mercy on me, Lord

Have mercy on me

(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) have mercy on me, Lord

Have mercy on me

(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) wait in the truck

Just wait in the truck

(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) wait in the truck

Just wait in the truck (please have me mercy)

--- 'All I Want for Christmas Is You' by Mariah Carey ---
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need 
I don't care about presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree 
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true... 

All I want for Christmas 

Is you... 



I don't want a lot for Christmas 

There is just one thing I need 

I don't care about presents 

Underneath the Christmas tree 

I don't need to hang my stocking 

There upon the fireplace 

Santa Claus won't make me happy 

With a toy on Christmas day 

I just want you for my own 

More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true 

All I want for Christmas is you... 

You baby 



I won't ask for much this Christmas 

I won't even wish for snow 

I'm just gonna keep on waiting 

Underneath the mistletoe 

I won't make a list and send it 

To the North Pole for Saint Nick 

I won't even stay awake to 

Hear those magic reindeer click 

'Cause I just want you here tonight 

Holding on to me so tight 

What more can I do 

Baby all I want for Christmas is you 

You... 



All the lights are shining 

So brightly everywhere 

And the sound of children's 

Laughter fills the air 

And everyone is singing 

I hear those sleigh bells ringing 

Santa won't you bring me the one I really need - 

won't you please bring my baby to me... 



Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas 

This is all I'm asking for 

I just want to see my baby 

Standing right outside my door 

Oh I just want him for my own 

More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true 

Baby all I want for Christmas is 

You... 



All I want for Christmas is you baby... all I want for Chrismas is you baby....

--- 'Everything I Love' by Morgan Wallen ---
Wish I would've met you
Anywhere but where I did
Some old high rise town that
I won't ever go again
I wish we woulda rolled around
In some old cab and chased them city lights

And hit bars I don't like



We were listenin' to one more silver dollar

Hanging out my Silverado

Down a road I love to ride



Wish I would've known that by

Now, you'd be good and gone

And you'd leave us

In a cloud of dust

Can't you see what you're doin', girl?

You ruined damn near everything I love



I don't care how much they're bitin'

I won't even crank thе boat

Soon as that bobber hits the water

Girl, your mеmory starts to float

Baby, why'd l'd ever take the bait

And take you places that I love to go?

Hell, I'll never know



I even took you to my hometown to meet my Mama

Now, I'm gonna see you everytime

I see that welcome sign



Wish I would've known that by

Now, you'd be good and gone

And you'd leave us

In a cloud of dust

Can't you see what you're doin', girl?

You ruined damn near everything I love





I don't wanna hear one more silver dollar

I can't take my Silverado down them

Roads we used to ride



Wish I would've known that by

Now, you'd be good and gone

And you'd leave us

In a cloud of dust

Can't you see what you're doin', girl?

You ruined damn near everything I love



I can't go nowhere near the whiskey

'Cause you used to drink it with me

In the bed of my truck

And now, I can't get drunk

Can't you see what you're doin', girl?

You ruined damn near everything I love

Can't you see what you're doin', girl?

You ruined damn near everything I love

'Cause I couldn't leave you if I tried
You break me, then I break my rules

Last time was the last time too

It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still



Outside of the party, smokin' in the car with you

Seven Nation Army, fightin' at the bar with you

Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do

'Cause I can't let go, it's chemical

No, I can't let go, it's chemical



Every time I'm ready to make a change (Mhm)

You turn around and fuck out all my brains (Whoo)

I ain't tryna find fate, it's too late to save face

I can't get away, maybe there's no mistakes (Maybe there's no mistakes)

--- 'Heart Like a Truck' by Lainey Wilson ---
I never stay in one place too long
The dirt road singin' me a siren's song
I gotta find a field, I need to spin my wheels
I gotta hankerin' for four wide tires
And I can't help it, it's the way I'm wired
Boy, you get too close, boy, you need to know



I got a heart like a truck

It's been drug through the mud

Runs on dreams and gasoline

And that old highway holds the key

It's got a lead foot down when it's leavin'

Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beatin'

A little bit of love is all that it's needin'

But it's good as it is tough

I got a heart like a truck



There ain't no brakin' when I throw it in drive

Don't always keep it in-between the lines

If you're a ready for a ridе

Pedal down state of mind

Boy, I tell you what

You bеtter buckle up



I got a heart like a truck

It's been drug through the mud

Runs on dreams and gasoline

And that old highway holds the key

Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beatin'

A little bit of love is all that it's needin'

But it's good as it is tough

Go on and see if you can knock off the dust, yeah

Shine it up, rev it up, and let it run, yeah

--- 'Going, Going, Gone' by Luke Combs ---
Some things in life are meant to fly
And others, they were born to run
You can't tie down up and leaving
Like the changing of the seasons
Good things, they come and then they go

Like a runaway southbound train

Like an Arizona desert rain

Like lightning in the sky

Like fireworks in July

Like a left field home run ball

Like a whiskey shot at last call

It's like she was made for moving on

That girl is going, going, gone



I can say it wasn't meant to be

Or maybe meant to be's misunderstood

Can't hold on to letting go

Or change the way the river flows

Loving her's like roping in the wind



Like a runaway southbound train

Like an Arizona desert rain

Like lightning in the sky

Like fireworks in July

Like a left field home run ball

Like a whiskey shot at last call

It's like she was made for moving on

That girl is going, going, gone



She ain't got one bit of stick around

There's no sense in trying to slow her down



Like a runaway southbound train

Like an Arizona desert rain

Like lightning in the sky

Like fireworks in July

Like a left field home run ball

Like a whiskey shot at last call

It's like she was made for moving on

That girl is going, going, gone



Going, going, gone

Going, going, gone

--- 'Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree' by Brenda Lee ---
Rockin' around the Christmas tree, at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see, every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feelin' when you hear

Voices singin' let's be jolly

Deck the halls with boughs of holly



Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday

Everyone dancing merrily in the new, old-fashioned way



You will get a sentimental feelin' when you hear

Voices singin' let's be jolly

Deck the halls with boughs of holly



Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday

Everyone dancing merrily in the new, old-fashioned way

--- 'Dancin' in the Country' by Tyler Hubbard ---
Them neon lights
Look good on you, so good on you
But we ain't got
No room to move, no room to move
We need some space and I know a place
Outside of town where it don't ever close down

No, we never close down



Yeah, we can two-step

Put your boots on, baby, we can do that

Girl, cut a little loose, you can move that

Move that, aw, yeah



I'll take you dancin' in the country, Levi's in them low beams

Spin you in some red dirt, sweep you off of both feet

Out here where the sun sets, Silverado backbeat

You'll never wanna go home and never wanna not be

Dancin' in the country

Dancin' in the country



Yeah, it goes left, right, left

You makin' me wanna sway

You makin' me wanna play

Some Alabama and Jackson

Got you 'round my neck

You makin' me wanna stay

You makin' me wanna lay

You down here in the pasture



Yeah, we can two-step

Put your boots on, baby, we can do that

Girl, cut a little loose, you can move that

Move that, aw, yeah



I'll take you dancin' in the country, Levi's in them low beams

--- 'Daylight' by David Kushner ---
Telling myself "I won't go there"
Oh but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by our pride and guilt



(Ooh)

There's darkness in the distance

From the way that I've been livin'

But I know I can't resist it



Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

You and I drink the poison from the same vine

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight

From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight

From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time



Tellin' myself it's the last time

Can you spare any mercy that you might find

If I'm down on my knees again

Deep down, way down, Lord, I try

Try to follow your light, but it's night time

Please, don't leave me in the end



(Ooh)

There's darkness in the distance

I'm beggin' for forgiveness (Ooh)

But I know I might resist it, oh



Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

You and I drink the poison from the same vine

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight

From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight

From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time



Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

You and I drink the poison from the same vine

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight

From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight

From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

--- 'Lift Me Up' by Rihanna ---
Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me close
Safe and sound
Burning in a hopeless dream

Hold me when you go to sleep

Keep me in the warmth of your love

When you depart, keep me safe

Safe and sound



Lift me up

Hold me down

Keep me close

Safe and sound



Drowning in an endless sea

Take some time and stay with me

Keep me in the strength of your arms

Keep me safe

Safe and sound



Lift me up

Hold me down

Keep me safe

Safe and sound



Burning in a hopeless dream

Hold me when you go to sleep

Keep me safe

We need light, we need love



(Lift me up) Lift me up in your arms

(Hold me down) I need love, I need love, I need love

(Keep me close) Hold me, hold me

(Safe and sound) Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

(Lift me up) Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

(Hold me down) Hold me, hold me

(Keep me safe) We need light, we need love

--- 'Eyes Closed' by Ed Sheeran ---
I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while my dear
Dealing with the cards life dealt

I'm still holding back these tears

While my friends are somewhere else



I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February

I step in the bar, it hit me so hard

Oh how can it be this heavy?

Every song reminds me you're gone

And I feel thе lump form in my throat

'Cause I'm here alonе



Just dancing with my eyes closed

'Cause everywhere I look I still see you

Time is moving so slow

And I don't know what else that I can do

So I'll keep dancing with my



Eye-ye-eye-eyes

Eye-ye-eye-eyes closed

Eye-ye-eye-eyes

Oh, I keep dancin' with my



Delusion is here again

And I think you'll come home soon

A word brings me right back in

Then it's only me that’s in this room

I guess I could just pretend

The colours are more than blue

But I lost more than my friend

I can't help but missing you



I pictured this month a little bit different no one is ever ready

And when it unfolds you get in a hole

Oh how can it be this heavy?

Everything changes, nothing’s the same

Except the truth is now you’re gone

And life just goes on



So I'm dancin' with my eyes closed

'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you

Time is movin' so slow

And I don't know what else that I can do

So I'll keep dancin' with my



Eye-ye-eye-eyes

Eye-ye-eye-eyes closed

Eye-ye-eye-eyes

Oh, I'll keep dancin' with my

Eye-ye-eye-eyes

Eye-ye-eye-eyes closed

Eye-ye-eye-eyes

Oh, I'll keep dancin' with my



They're shutting the bar, they're cleaning the floors

And everyone is already home

But I'm on my own



Just dancin' with my eyes closed

'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you

Time is movin' so slow

And I don't know what else that I can do

So I keep dancin' with my



Eye-ye-eye-eyes

Eye-ye-eye-eyes closed

Eye-ye-eye-eyes

Oh, I keep dancin' with my

Eye-ye-eye-eyes

Eye-ye-eye-eyes closed

Eye-ye-eye-eyes

Oh, I keep dancin' with my

--- 'TQG' by Karol G and Shakira ---
La que te dijo que un vacío se llena con otra persona, te miente
Es como tapar una herida con maquillaje, no se ve, pero se siente
Te fuiste diciendo que me superaste y te conseguiste nueva novia
Lo que ella no sabe es que tú todavía me estás viendo toda' las historias
Bebé, ¿qué fue?

¿No pues que muy tragadito?

¿Qué haces buscándome el lado?

Si sabes que yo errores no repito

Dile a tu nueva bebé

Que por hombres no compito

Que deje de estar tirando

Que al menos yo te tenía bonito



Verte con la nueva me dolió

Pero ya estoy puesta pa' lo mío

Lo que vivimos se me olvidó

Y eso es lo que te tiene ofendido



Que hasta la vida me mejoró

Por acá ya no eres bienvenido

Vi lo que tu novia me tiró

Eso no da ni rabia, yo me río, yo me río



No tengo tiempo pa' lo que no aporte, ya cambié mi Norte

Haciendo dinero como deporte

Llenando la cuenta, los shows, el parking y el pasaporte

Estoy más dura, dicen los reportes



Ahora tú quieres volver, se te nota, mmm, sí

Espérame ahí, que yo soy idiota

Se te olvidó que estoy en otra

Y que te quedó grande la Bichota



Bebé, ¿qué fue?

¿No pues que muy tragadito?

¿Qué haces buscándome el lado?

Si sabes que yo errores no repito

Dile a tu nueva bebé

Que por hombres no compito

Que deje de estar tirando

Que al menos yo te tenía bonito



Shakira, Shakira



Tú te fuiste y yo me puse triple M

Más buena, más dura, más level

Volver contigo never

Tú eras la mala suerte porque ahora las bendiciones me llueven



Y quieres volver, ya lo suponía

Dándole like a las foto' mía'

Tú buscando por fuera la comida

Yo diciendo que era monotonía



Y ahora quieres volver, ya lo suponía

Dándole like a las foto' mía'

Te ves feliz con tu nueva vida, pero

Si ella supiera que me buscas todavía



Bebé, ¿qué fue?

¿No pues que muy tragadito?

¿Qué haces buscándome el lado?

Si sabes que yo errores no repito

Dile a tu nueva bebé

Que por hombres no compito

Que no tiene buena mano

Y al menos yo te tenía bonito

--- 'Try That in a Small Town' by Jason Aldean ---
Sucker punch somebody on a sidewalk
Car jack an old lady at a red light
Pull a gun on the owner of a liquor store
Ya think it's cool, well, act a fool if ya like
Cuss out a cop, spit in his face
Stomp on the flag and light it up

Yeah, ya think you're tough



Well, try that in a small town

See how far ya make it down the road

'Round here we take care of our own

You cross that line, it won't take long

For you to find out, I recommend you don't

Try that in a small town



Got a gun that my granddad gave me

They say one day they're gonna round up

Well, that shit might fly in the city, good luck



Well, try that in a small town

See how far ya make it down the road

'Round here we take care of our own

You cross that line, it won't take long

For you to find out, I recommend you don't



Try that in a small town

Full of good ol' boys, raised up right

If you're looking for a fight

Try that in a small town

Try that in a small town



Try that in a small town

(See how far ya make it down the road)

'Round here we take care of our own

You cross that line, it won't take long

For you to find out, I recommend you don't

Try that in a small town

Try that in a small town, mm-mm

--- 'Tennessee Orange' by Megan Moroney ---
Mama, I'm callin', I've got some news
Don't you tell daddy, he'll blow a fuse
Don't worry, I'm doin' okay
I know you raised me to know right from wrong
It ain't what you think and I'm still writin' songs
Just never thought I'd see the day

I've never felt this way

I met somebody and he's got blue eyes

He opens the door and he don't make me cry

He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah

He's got me doin' things I've never done

In Georgia, they call it a sin

I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

Took me to Knoxville last Saturday

And I wore the hat on his dash to the game

Sure wasn't Athens but I

Fell for him under those Neyland lights

I met somebody and he's got blue eyes

He opens the door and he don't make me cry

He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah

He's got me doin' things I've never done

In Georgia, they call it a sin

I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

Mama, forgive me, I like him a lot

Hell, I'm learnin' the words to old Rocky Top

And he's got a smile that makes me forget

I've always looked better in red

But I met somebody and he's got blue eyes

He opens the door and he don't make me cry

He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah

He's got me doin' things I've never done

I met somebody and he's got blue eyes

He opens the door and he don't make me cry

He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah

He's got me doin' things I've never done

In Georgia they call it a sin

And I'll steal all the dogs to him

But I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells rock

Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time

Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square

In the frosty air



What a bright time, it's the right time

To rock the night away

Jingle bell time is a swell time

To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh



Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet

Jingle around the clock

Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet

That's the jingle bell rock



Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells rock 

Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time

Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square

In the frosty air



What a bright time, it's the right time

To rock the night away

Jingle bell time is a swell time

To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh



Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet

Jingle around the clock

But have a cup of cheer

Have a holly, jolly Christmas

And when you walk down the street 

Say hello to friends you know 

And everyone you meet



Oh

Ho

The mistletoe 

Hung where you can see



Somebody waits for you

Kiss her once for me

Have a holly jolly Christmas

And in case you didn't hear



Oh by golly

Have a holly

Jolly Christmas this year



Have a holly, jolly Christmas

It's the best time of the year

--- 'I Remember Everything' by Zach Bryan featuring Kacey Musgraves ---
Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind
Beach town rests on the drying line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hanging out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowing in my eyes

Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry



Do you remember that beat-down basement couch?

I'd sing you my love songs, and you'd tell me about

How your momma ran off and pawned her ring

I remember, I remember everything



A cold shoulder at closing time, you were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose

Strange words come on out of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke

Pictures and passing time, you only smile like that when you're drinking

I wish I didn't, but I do remember every moment on the nights with you



You're drinking everything to ease your mind

But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?

You're like concrete feet in the summer heat

That burns like hell when two souls meet

No, you'll never be the man that you always swore

But I'll remember you singing in that '88 Ford



A cold shoulder at closing time, you were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose

Strange words come on out of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke

Pictures and passing time, you only smile like that when you're drinking

I wish I didn't, but I do remember every moment on the nights with you



A cold shoulder at closing time, you were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose

I like you, I do, mmm, I do (I do)

--- 'Nobody Gets Me' by SZA ---
Took a long vacation, no make-up, just JAY-Z
You were balls deep, now we beefin', and we butt-naked at the MGMs
So wasted, screamin' "Fuck that", love me now, but I'm anythin'
Hurry now, baby, stick it in 'fore the memories get to kickin' in
It's too late, I don't wanna lose

What's left of you

How am I supposed to deal with it?

I don't wanna see you with anyone but me

Nobody gets me like you

How am I supposed to let you go?

Only like myself when I'm with you

Nobody gets me, you do (Do)

You do, nobody gets me, you do (Do)

You do, nobody gets me, you do

You do, nobody gets me, you do



Took me out to the ballet, you proposеd, I went on the road

You was feelin' empty so you lеft me, now I'm stuck, dealin' with a deadbeat

If I'm real, I deserve less, if I was you, I wouldn't take me back

I pretend when I'm winnin' madness to you

And I know that it's too late, I don't wanna lose



What's left of you

How am I supposed to deal with it?

I don't wanna see you with anyone but me

Nobody gets me like you

How am I supposed to let you go?

Only like myself when I'm with you

Nobody gets me, you do (Do)

You do, nobody gets me, you do (Do)

You do, nobody gets me, you do

You do, nobody gets me, you do

--- 'Super Freaky Girl' by Nicki Minaj ---
She's alright
That girl's alright with me
Yeah
Ay, yo

I can lick it, I can ride it

While you slippin' and slidin'

I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it

You can smack it, you can grip it

You can go down and kiss it

And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it

He want a F-R-EEEEE-A-K

F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K

EEEEE-A-K

F-R-EEEEE-A-K



One thing about me, I'm the baddest alive

He know the prettiest bitch didn't come until I arrive

I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try

I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind

They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try

A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive

His ex bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive

On applications I write, "Pressure", 'cause that's what I apply (Brrrr)

Pressure applied, can't fuck a regular guy

Wetter than umbrellas and stickier than Apple Pie



I can lick it, I can ride it

While you slippin' and slidin'

I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it

You can smack it, you can grip it

You can go down and kiss it

And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it

'Cause what the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga, custom down?

Like, what the fuck, this ain't Burberry, custom brown?

He said, "Could you throw it back while you touch the ground?"

Then he said, "Do that pussy purr?" I said, "Yup, meow"

Hold up, fuck boys, ain't no need for you to roll up

Ain't no need for you to double tap neither, scroll up

Keep these bitches on they toes like Manolo

Be on the lookout when I come through, BOLO

Oh, whoa

Elegant bitch with a hoe glow

If it ain't big, then I won't blow

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe

--- 'Dial Drunk' by Noah Kahan and Post Malone ---
Rememberin' I promised to forget you now
But it's rainin' and I'm callin' drunk
And my medicine is drowning your perspective out
So I ain't taking any fault
Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be?
I doubt it, forget about it, whatever

It's all the same anyways



I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown

In the name of someone I no longer know

For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone

Traffic lights and a transmitter radio

I don't like that, when they threw me in the car

I gave your name as my emergency phone call

Honey, it rang and rang, even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up

I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'll die for you



I'm untethering from the parts of me you recognize

From charming to alarming in seconds

I'll be bedridden, I'll let the pain metastasize

But that's morning, I'll forget it

And the dial tone is all I have



I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown

In the name of someone I no longer know

For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone

Traffic lights and a transmitter radio

I don't like that, when they threw me in the car

I gave your name as my emergency phone call

Honey, it rang and rang, even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up

I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you

Well, I'd die for you



Thank you, sir, just let me call

I'll give you my blood alcohol

I'll rock with all the burnouts in the cell

I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag

Just wait, I swear she'll call me back

Oh, son are you a danger to yourself?

Well, fuck that sir, just let me call

I'll give you my blood alcohol

I'll rock with all the burnouts in the cell

I'll change my faith, I'll kiss the badge

Just wait, I swear she'll call me back

Son, why do you do this to yourself?

And I said



I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown

In the name of someone I no longer know

For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone

Traffic lights and a transmitter radio

I don't like that, when they threw me in the car

I gave your name as my emergency phone call

Honey, it rang and rang, even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up

I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you

--- 'What Was I Made For?' by Billie Eilish ---
I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out, I'm not real

Just something you paid for

What was I made for?



'Cause I, I

I don't know how to feel

But I wanna try

I don't know how to feel

But someday I might

Someday I might



Mm, mm-mm, aah-ooh

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm



When did it end? All the enjoyment

I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend

It's not what he's made for

What was I made for?



'Cause I, 'cause I

I don't know how to feel

But I wanna try

I don't know how to feel

But someday I might

Someday I might



Think I forgot how to be happy

Something I'm not, but something I can be

Something I wait for

Something I'm made for

Something I'm made for

--- 'Wait for U' by Future featuring Drake and Tems ---
I will wait for you, for you
Early in the mornin', late at night (I will wait for you)
It doesn't even matter what time it is (I will wait for you)
Presidential Rollie already on the way (Tired, sayin', "Aye, yi, yi, yi")
Whenever I find time, it's okay (Ayy)
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob



You pray for my demons, girl, I got you

Every time I sip on codeine, I get vulnerable

I'm knowin' the sounds of the storm when it come

She understand I can't take her everywhere a nigga going

I been in the field like the childrеn of the corn



I can hear your tears whеn they drop over the phone

Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone

Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doing (Worried 'bout a Xanny)

Travel around the world (Would you brag, or would you try to get me?)

Over the phone, dropping tears (Tell me now, I know that you be braggin')

I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you so bad, yeah)

When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)

When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)

Please tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you)

Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)



Yeah, I been trappin' 'round the world

I sit on my balcony and wonder how you feelin'

I got a career that takes my time away from women

I cannot convince you that I love you for a livin' (Will wait for you, for you)

I be on your line, feelings flowin' like a river

You be textin' back you at Kiki on the river (I will wait for you)

Message say delivered (I will wait for you), but I know that you don't get it

Why you introduce us if you knew that you was with him? (I will wait for you, for you, for you)

Made me shake his hand when y'all been fuckin' for a minute (I will wait for you, for you)

Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I will wait for you)

Supposed to be your dog, but you done put me in a kennel

Girl, put a muzzle on it, all that barkin' over dinner

I was fuckin' with you when you had the tiny Presidential

You got better when you met me and that ain't coincidental

Tried to bring the best out you but, guess I'm not that influential

Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you



I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone

Get mad at myself 'cause I can't leave You alone

Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doing, yeah (Worried 'bout a Xanny)

Trappin' around the world (Would you brag, or would you try to get me?)

Over the phone, dropping tears (Tell me now, I know that you be braggin')

I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you too bad, yeah)

--- 'Last Christmas' by Wham! ---
[CHORUS:]
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears

I'll give it to someone special



[CHORUS:]



Once bitten and twice shy

I keep my distance

But you still catch my eye

Tell me baby

Do you recognize me?

Well

It's been a year

It doesn't surprise me

I wrapped it up and sent it

With a note saying "I love you"

I meant it

Now I know what a fool I've been

But if you kissed me now

I know you'd fool me again



[CHORUS]



A crowded room

Friends with tired eyes

I'm hiding from you

And your soul of ice

My god I thought you were

Someone to rely on

Me?

I guess I was a shoulder to cry on



A face on a lover with a fire in his heart

A man under cover but you tore me apart

Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again



[CHORUS x2]



A face on a lover with a fire in his heart

A man under cover buy you tore him apart

Maybe next year I'll give it to someone

I'll give it to someone special.

--- 'Handle on You' by Parker McCollum ---
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone
Dropped a needle on a vinyl and cried to an old Haggard song
Sittin' at the table, baby, breaking the seal
Gonna see how much of this pain I can kill
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone

Tennessee and Kentucky 'cause you ain't here to love me

I drink now that there's nothing to lose

I've been fightin' with your memory, I hate the way it hits me

I wake up every day, black and blue

After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do

Yeah, I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you



I tell myself that I should quit but I don't listen to drunks

I keep on sippin' till, "I miss you" don't roll off my tongue

Since you poured our love down the sink

I think I'll just stay here and drink

I tell myself that I should quit but I don't listen to drunks



Tennessee and Kentucky 'cause you ain't here to love me

I drink now that there's nothing to lose

I've been fightin' with your memory, I hate the way it hits me

I wake up every day, black and blue

After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do

Well, I finally got a handle on you



After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do

Yeah, I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you

Handle on you

Yeah, I finally got a handle on you

--- 'Por Las Noches' by Peso Pluma ---
Cuando por las noches recordaba todo
El olor de aquel perfume, sobre todo
Las sábanas blancas donde te escondías dentro
Eres intocable como joya de oro
Esas piernas largas comerme yo solo

Y tus ojos grandes, me perdí en un laberinto



Y pensar

Que tú ya no vas a estar

Pasará

Solito me dejarás

Intentar

Solo un beso y tú te vas

De mi vida, ah, oh

Como tú no hay nadie más



No hay nadie más



Si te sientes sola, no me llames, por fa'

Me pongo sensible, imagino tu sombra

Clase Azul es el tequila e interior la ropa



Licor Prat champaña, el polvo es color rosa

Me contactó un ángel, eres tú, mi hermosa

La que me alegra los días y sigo tomando



Y pensar

Que tú ya no vas a estar

Pasará

Solito me dejarás

Intentar

Solo un beso y tú te vas

De mi vida, ah, oh

Como tú no hay nadie más



No hay nadie más

--- 'Memory Lane' by Old Dominion ---
If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I'd put my money down and I'd sign my name
On that little corner lot where it don't ever rain
And we'd stay good as new like a fresh coat of paint
You'd be mine in the shine of a front porch light
Yeah, I might as well live there, baby

That's where I spend most of my time



Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights

Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise

Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes

You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder

We'd never let go and we'd never be over



If I could buy a house on Memory Lane

I wouldn't have to wonder if you miss me the same

I'd be loving you as usual, telling you you're beautiful

Oh, I'd be happily delusional



Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights

Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise

Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes

You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder

We'd never let go and we'd never be over



Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights

Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise

Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes

You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder

We'd never let go and we'd never be over



If I could buy a house on Memory Lane

I'd put my money down and I'd sign my name

On that little corner lot where it don't ever rain

And baby, me and you, we'd never fade, never fade

We'd never fade

Never fade, never fade

10 miles outta Chattanooga
South of that state line

There's a no-name road off Highway 2

Just past the welcome sign

It's where I was born, it's where I was raised

Ain't sayin' I'm ready yet

But that's the place I wanna be after my last breath



Bury me in Georgia

Let me rest in peace

Underneath the pines, yeah, yeah, yeah

Where my roots run deep (Where my roots run deep)

And remember what I told ya

When I die, bury me in Georgia

Mhm



Yeah, I don't care what color my suit is

Or what shoes y'all put on my feet

I don't care how many show up, yeah

Or who reads my eulogy

Just take me out to that graveyard

Sing a send-me-home song

Put "Go Dawgs" on my headstone

And pile that red dirt on



Bury me in Georgia

Let me rest in peace

Underneath the pines, yeah, yeah, yeah

Where my roots run deep (Where my roots run deep)

When it's my day, put me in that clay

--- 'PRC' by Peso Pluma and Natanael Cano ---
Me levanto, un baño y, luego, me pongo a forjar
Es veneno, da pa' arriba de muy buena calidad
Los teléfonos no paran nunca de sonar
Si bien es alguna plebita, es porque un cliente quiere más
Y, bien forrados, los paquetes van

No hay pendiente, no puedo fallar

Siempre estoy listo para cruzar

Polvo, ruedas y también cristal



Aquí, el papelito viene y va

Las morritas bien locas se van

Disfrutamos este bien o mal

De esta vida, no me vo'a quejar



¡Eah!

Y bien jalados con la Doble P

Los corridos tumbados

Así nomás, viejo



Fino con las Balenciaga

Corridos bien verga sonaban

Las morritas, muy bien, bailaban

Y yo ando silver, LV



Siento que ando volando ya, carnal

Y, aquí, nunca nos vamos a quejar

¿Para qué vamos a voltear pa' atrás?

Ni pedo, yo le voy a atorar



Y, bien forrados, los paquetes van

No hay pendiente, no puedo fallar

Siempre estoy listo para cruzar

Polvo, ruedas y también cristal



Y, bien forrados, los paquetes van

No hay pendiente, no puedo fallar

Siempre estoy listo para cruzar

--- 'What My World Spins Around' by Jordan Davis ---
I love a first cast when the water's glass and the line starts to run
Or that first sip of a cold beer when the working week's done
I love the twilight in the morning 'fore the day wakes up
With the windows down on the first ride in a paid-up truck
And I love a slow down in a beach town with an ocean view
And I love a first fall Saturday trip down to Baton Rouge

And I love a six-string with the stars out and the campfire glow

But girl, that don't even come close



To the way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me

The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy

I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'

That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin'

And I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it

I can't imagine me livin' without this

Back forty view on our piece of ground

Watching you watch the sun going down

That's what my world spins around



Well, I finally get it now, when they say you know, you know

And yeah, girl, you had me from that first hello

And the only thing better is Heaven above

But until I get there, I'll never get enough of



The way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me

The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy

I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'

That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin', and

I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it

I can't imagine me livin' without this

Back forty view on our piece of ground

Watching you watch the sun going down

That's what my world spins around



What my world spins around

Oh, yeah



The way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me

The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy

And I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'

And that look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin', and

I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it

I can't imagine me livin' without this

Back forty view on our piece of ground

Watching you watch the sun goin' down

That's what my world spins around



You're what my world spins around

Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y'd this
Man, ain't that some shit

That you'd hate to grow up and miss

Hate to think of what if

I didn't even know what a honey hole with a Zebco

And my jeans rolled and a pinch of Skoal in my lip even is

They say we ain't got a pot to piss but I thank God for this



Ain't that some back home buddies in a field mud on the wheels

Ain't that some, ain't that some, ain't that some shit

But that's just the way it is out here

Ain't that some shit

Ain't that some, ain't that some, ain't that some shit

--- 'Wild as Her' by Corey Kent ---
She never wanted to be white-picket fenced in
Her heart's like a feather in a Tulsa wind
Seaside breeze'll bring her to life
And all them other boys say she's a goodbye girl
She'll wreck your world
And leave before the mornin' sun

But here she is, free, lyin' next to me

'Cause I ain't tryna tame her love



I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair

Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn

She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned

Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her

Wild

Wild



Saw that highway unwind in her deep-brown eyes

She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine

She ain't livin' for a diamond ring

Just livin' like the rock 'n' roll song she sings out loud

We're burnin' it down

Blazin' up a trail of smoke

Wherever we are, wherever we go

Yeah, that's where she calls home



I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair

Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn

She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned

Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her

Wild

Wild

Yeah, yeah, man



Yeah

I ain't tryna fix her, I just wanna kiss her

Fuel a little fire in her soul

No, we don't say "forever," but when we're together

Swear that we ain't ever lettin' go, yeah, she knows



I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair

Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn

She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned

Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her

Wild

Wild



Yeah

--- 'I Wrote the Book' by Morgan Wallen ---
When it comes to
Hitchin' the boat up
Backin' down the ramp
In my old truck
To find a bunch of logs
To catch a bunch of hogs

Yeah, I wrote the book

Yeah, I wrote the book



If you wanna learn

To throw a curve right

To catch a clean up

Lookin' on a third strike

Talk a little smack

While he's walkin' back

Yeah, I wrote the book



But there's one that lays by

The lamp on the nightstand

One that says don't cuss and don't fight

Or let the bottle turn you into a different man



But damn if I don't do it every Friday night

Those get you into Heaven letters in red

Ain't gettin' read enough to

Keep me on a straight line

I'm a Jack of all trades

But man I gotta say

That's one book I didn't write



I met a good girl

She had her life straight

She said she loved that I was good at everythin'

One day she left me in a cloud of dust

'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up



The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand

The one that says don't cuss and don't fight

Or let the bottle turn you into a different man



But damn if I don't do it every Friday night

Those get you into Heaven letters in red

Ain't gettin' read enough to

Keep me on a straight line

I'm a lack of all trades

But man I gotta say

That's one book I didn't write



Yeah the good Lord knows I need it

I didn't write it but I probably oughta read it



The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand

One that says don't cuss and don't fight

Or let the bottle turn you into a different man



But damn if I don't do it every Friday night

Those get you into Heaven letters in red

Ain't gettin' read enough to

Keep me on a straight line

I'm a lack of all trades

But man I gotta say



That's one book I didn't write

That's one book I didn't write

That's one book I didn't write

--- 'Bloody Mary' by Lady Gaga ---
Honey
Oh
Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone
I'll tell them my religion's you

When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne

I'm ready for their stones



I'll dance, dance, dance

With my hands, hands, hands

Above my head, head, head

Like Jesus said

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance

With my hands, hands, hands above my head

Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...



I won't cry for you

I won't crucify the things you do

I won't cry for you

See (see), when you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary



Love



We are not just art for Michelangelo to carve

He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart

I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris, cold

Je ne veux pas mourir tout seule



I'll dance, dance, dance

With my hands, hands, hands

Above my head, head, head

Like Jesus said

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance

With my hands, hands, hands above my head

Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...



I won't cry for you

I won't crucify the things you do

I won't cry for you

See (see), when you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary



Love

--- 'Watermelon Moonshine' by Lainey Wilson ---
It was right after senior year
Just before the summer disappeared
We went a-ridin' them old farm ruts
Hangin' out on the gate of his truck
We threw a blanket 'neath the sunset
Bein' brave as eighteen gets

We gave each other more than our hearts

With the help of a mason jar



Drinkin' watermelon moonshine

Cut the burn with a little lime

Parkin' back in them kudzu vines

I was his and every bit of that boy was minе

Too young to know what love was

But we werе learnin' on a sweet buzz

There's never nothin' like the first time

And mine's always gonna taste like

Watermelon moonshine



I don't remember where we got it from

I just remember feelin' all grown up

Takin' pulls like it ain't no thing

Never told him it was my first drink

But I told him that he was the one

You're so sure when you're that young

You think you got it all figured out

And now I laugh when I think about



Drinkin' watermelon moonshine

Cut the burn with a little lime

Parkin' back in them kudzu vines

I was his and every bit of that boy was mine

Too young to know what love was

But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz

There's never nothin' like the first time

And mine's always gonna taste like

Watermelon moonshine



I thought that high would last forever

But that ain't what it does

Maybe we were drunk in love

Or maybe we were just



Drinkin' watermelon moonshine

Cut the burn with a little lime

Parkin' back in them kudzu vines

I was his and every bit of that boy was mine

Too young to know what love was

But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz

There's never nothin' like the first time

And mine's always gonna taste like

Watermelon moonshine

Watermelon moonshine
