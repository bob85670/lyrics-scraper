--- 'Heat Waves' by Glass Animals ---
(Last night all I think about is you
Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't wanna but I think about you
You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision

Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



Usually I put somethin' on TV

So we never think about you and me

But today I see our reflections clearly

In Hollywood, layin' on the screen

You just need a better life than this

You need somethin' I can never give

Fake water all across the road

It's gone now, the night has come, but



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



You can't fight it, you can't breathe

You say somethin' so lovin', but

Now I gotta let you go

You'll be better off in someone new

I don't wanna be alone

You know it hurts me too

You look so broken when you cry

One more and then I say goodbye



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



I just wonder what you're dreamin' of

When you sleep and smile so comfortable

I just wish that I could give you that

That look that's perfectly un-sad

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Heat waves been fakin' me out



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



Road shimmer wigglin' the vision

Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision

Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

--- 'As It Was' by Harry Styles ---
Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?

Nothin' to say

And everything gets in the way

Seems you cannot be replaced

And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh



In this world, it's just us

You know it's not the same as it was

In this world, it's just us

You know it's not the same as it was

As it was, as it was

You know it's not the same



Answer the phone

"Harry, you're no good alone

Why are you sitting at home on the floor?

What kind of pills are you on?"

Ringin' the bell

And nobody's coming to help

Your daddy lives by himself

He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh



In this world, it's just us

You know it's not the same as it was

In this world, it's just us

You know it's not the same as it was

As it was, as it was

You know it's not the same



Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet

I don't wanna talk about the way that it was

Leave America, two kids follow her

I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first



(Hey)

As it was

You know it's not the same as it was

As it was, as it was

--- 'Easy on Me' by Adele ---
There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drownin' in the silence
Baby, let me in



Go easy on me, baby

I was still a child

Didn't get the chance to

Feel the world around me

I had no time to choose what I chose to do

So go easy on me



There ain't no room for our things to change

When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways

You can't deny how hard I've tried

I changed who I was to put you both first

But now I give up



Go еasy on me, baby

I was still a child

Didn't get the chancе to

Feel the world around me

Had no time to choose what I chose to do

So go easy on me



I had good intentions

And the highest hopes

But I know right now

It probably doesn't even show



Go easy on me, baby

I was still a child

I didn't get the chance to

Feel the world around me

I had no time to choose what I chose to do

So go easy on me

--- 'Shivers' by Ed Sheeran ---
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that taste like yours
Strawberries and somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar, ooh
Fill up the engines, we can drive real far

Go dancing underneath the stars

Ooh, yeah, I want it all, mm

Ooh, you got me feeling like



I wanna be that guy

I wanna kiss your eyes

I wanna drink that smile

I wanna feel like I'm

Like my soul's on fire

I wanna stay up all day and all night, mm

Yeah, you got me singing like



Ooh, I love it when you do it like that

And when you're close up, give me thе shivers

Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

And whеn they say the party's over then we bring it right back

And we say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that

And when you're close up, give me the shivers

Oh, baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

And when they say the party's over then we bring it right back



Into the car, on the back seat in the moon lit dark

Wrap me up between your legs and arms

Ooh, I can't get enough

You know you could tear me apart

Put me back together and take my heart

I never thought that I could love this hard

Ooh, I can't get enough

Ooh, you got me feeling like



I wanna be that guy

I wanna kiss your eyes

I wanna drink that smile

I wanna feel like I'm

Like my soul's on fire

I wanna stay up all day and all night

Yeah, you got me singing like



Ooh, I love it when you do it like that

And when you're close up, give me the shivers

Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

And when they say the party's over then we bring it right back

And we say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that

And when you're close up, give me the shivers

Oh, baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

And when they say the party's over then we bring it right back



Baby, you are so hot you make me shiver

With the fire you got, this thing is started

I don't want it to stop, you know you make me shiver, oh, oh

Baby, you are so hot you make me shiver

With the fire you got, this thing is started

I don't want it to stop, you know you make me shiver

Yeah, you got me singing like



Ooh, I love it when you do it like that

And when you're close up, give me the shivers

Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

And when they say the party's over then we bring it right back

And we say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that

And when you're close up, give me the shivers

Oh, baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

And when they say the party's over then we bring it right back (Yeah)

--- 'First Class' by Jack Harlow ---
Mm
I been a G, throw up the L
Sex in the A.M., uh-huh
O-R-O-U-S, yeah
And I could put you in first class
Up in the sky

I could put you in first class

Up in the—, up-up in the—

I been a G, throw up the L

Sex in the A.M., uh-huh

O-R-O-U-S, yeah

And I could put you in first class

Up in the sky, mm, mm

I could put you in first class

Up in the—, up-up in the—



I could see the whole city from this balcony

Back in 2019, I was outside freely, but now they got it out for me

I don't care what frat that you was in, you can't alpha me, keep dreaming

Pineapple juice, I give her sweet, sweet, sweet semen

I know what they like so I just keep cheesin'

Hard drive full of heat seekin'

Tryna come the same day as Jack, rethink it

Y'all don't need Givenchy, you need Jesus

Why do y'all sleep on me? I need reasons

Uh, I got plaques in thе mail, peak season

Shout out to my UPS workers, makin' surе I receive 'em

You could do it too, believe it



I been a G, throw up the L

Sex in the A.M., uh-huh

O-R-O-U-S, yeah

And I could put you in first class

Up in the sky, mm, mm

I could put you in first class

Up in the—, up-up in the—



Are you ready? Ha, yes I am

They say "You a superstar now, damn", I guess I am

You might be the man, well that's unless I am

Okay, I'll confess I am

Go ahead and get undressed, I am

Okay cool, you want sunset? I am

I'm about to slide, okay

I'm outside, okay this lifestyle don't got many downsides

Except for the lack of time I get 'round my family

Making sure they never downsize

I got visions of my mom saying, "Wait, this house mine?"

Can't lie, I'm on Angus, Cloud 9

I got 'em on the bandwagon now, about time

I ain't even got no downtime

Every time I speak, she say, "Yeah, that sounds fine"



I been a G, throw up the L

Sex in the A.M., uh-huh

O-R-O-U-S, yeah

And I could put you in first class

Up in the sky

I could put you in first class

Up in the—, up-up in the—

I been a G, throw up the L

Sex in the A.M., uh-huh

O-R-O-U-S, yeah

And I could put you in first class

Up in the sky, mm, mm

I could put you in first class

--- 'Ghost' by Justin Bieber ---
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know your cross the bridge I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get
I want you to know that



If I can't be close to you

I'll settle for the ghost of you

I miss you more than life

And if you can't be next to me

Your memory is ecstasy

I miss you more than life

I miss you more than life



Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow

I need more time, but time can't be borrowed

I'd leave it all behind if I could follow



Since the love that you left is all that I get

I want you to know that



If I can't be close to you

I'll settle for the ghost of you

I miss you more than life

And if you can't be next to me

Your memory is ecstasy

I miss you more than life

I miss you more than life

I miss you more than life

If I can't be close to you

I'll settle for the ghost of you

I miss you more than life

And if you can't be next to me

Your memory is ecstasy

I miss you more than life

I miss you more than life

--- 'Super Gremlin' by Kodak Black ---
Yeah, we could be superstars
We been rather wreckin' cars (Ayy bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stake for us?
Kickin' off power mirrors
Yeah, we could be superstars
But I'm pretty sure our time is up

And so we fell off the spinning tops

Don't know, maybe for trial

But way more error (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)



Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer

Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you

Go against any nigga, like, fuck this glitter

Skeet off third, I'm busy

I put it in for you, I spin for you

Whatever you with, I'm with it

How you gon' cross a nigga that was rockin' with you? I got you lit in the city

I been multitaskin', rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children

I been standin' on business, and spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy

I do all the smackin', you ain't never stepped or helped with none of this killin'

You doin' a lot of cappin', watch when I catch you, I'ma whack you in front of thе witness



Damn, my nigga, you trippin'

We could've been supеrstars

Remember when we was jackin' cars

Now, it's not safe for you

You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch

Damn, my nigga, you trippin'

We could've been superstars

Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing

Remember when we was jackin' cars

Now, you better keep your distance

'Cause it's not safe for you

You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch



Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on the bitch when I slide

Nightlight on the blick, bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside

Zoe done ran down, caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted

I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin



Yeah, Kutthroat Businezz, KTB, backdoor wide open

Wait 'til my sniper get out, all you niggas gon' die, time rollin'

Bustin' on my opponent, no half-steppin', crushin' my opps totally

We was just broke with no motion

Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches

I done went cages, to stages, to cages

Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby

I beat them cases, they already hate me

They gon' want me dead when I'm on probation

Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?

Y'all ain't seen none yet, I promise

Niggas can't take me, niggas can't guard me

I be on a fuck nigga ass like Charmin

AK, twenty-inch carbon



We could've been superstars

Remember when we was jackin' cars

Now, it's not safe for you

You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch

Damn, my nigga, you trippin'

We could've been superstars

Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing

Remember when we was jackin' cars

Now, you better keep your distance

'Cause it's not safe for you

You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch



Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on the bitch when I slide

Nightlight on the blick, bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside

Zoe done ran down, caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted

I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin



Yeah, we could be superstars (Super Gremlin)

But I'm pretty sure our time is up (Now your time is up)

And so we fell off the spinning tops

Don't know, maybe for trial, but way more error

I ain't slimy, I'm grimy

Any way you put it, I'm SG with it, I'm Super Gremlin

Snatch and grab, sneak and geek, Sniper Gang, trust

Nightmare, baby, you know I-

I bet you always see me in your dreams

--- 'Cold Heart (Pnau Remix)' by Elton John and Dua Lipa ---
(Oh)
(You're my cold heart)
(Oh)
It's a human sign
When things go wrong

When the scent of her lingers

And temptation's strong



Cold, cold heart

Hardened by you (Oh)

Some things lookin' better, baby

Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)



And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

I'm not the man they think I am at home

Oh no, no, no

And this is what I should have said

Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid



Cold, cold heart

Hardened by you (Oh)

Some things lookin' better, baby

Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)



And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

I'm not the man they think I am at home

Oh no, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)

And this is what I should have said

Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid



Cold, cold heart (Oh)

Hardened by you

Some things lookin' better, baby (Oh)

Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)



And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

I'm not the man they think I am at home

Oh no, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)

And this is what I should have said (And I think it's gonna be a long, long time)

('Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find)

Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid (I'm not the man they think I am at home)

--- 'Wait for U' by Future featuring Drake and Tems ---
I will wait for you, for you
Early in the mornin', late at night (I will wait for you)
It doesn't even matter what time it is (I will wait for you)
Presidential Rollie already on the way (Tired, sayin', "Aye, yi, yi, yi")
Whenever I find time, it's okay (Ayy)
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob



You pray for my demons, girl, I got you

Every time I sip on codeine, I get vulnerable

I'm knowin' the sounds of the storm when it come

She understand I can't take her everywhere a nigga going

I been in the field like the childrеn of the corn



I can hear your tears whеn they drop over the phone

Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone

Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doing (Worried 'bout a Xanny)

Travel around the world (Would you brag, or would you try to get me?)

Over the phone, dropping tears (Tell me now, I know that you be braggin')

I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you so bad, yeah)

When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)

When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)

Please tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you)

Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)



Yeah, I been trappin' 'round the world

I sit on my balcony and wonder how you feelin'

I got a career that takes my time away from women

I cannot convince you that I love you for a livin' (Will wait for you, for you)

I be on your line, feelings flowin' like a river

You be textin' back you at Kiki on the river (I will wait for you)

Message say delivered (I will wait for you), but I know that you don't get it

Why you introduce us if you knew that you was with him? (I will wait for you, for you, for you)

Made me shake his hand when y'all been fuckin' for a minute (I will wait for you, for you)

Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I will wait for you)

Supposed to be your dog, but you done put me in a kennel

Girl, put a muzzle on it, all that barkin' over dinner

I was fuckin' with you when you had the tiny Presidential

You got better when you met me and that ain't coincidental

Tried to bring the best out you but, guess I'm not that influential

Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you



I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone

Get mad at myself 'cause I can't leave You alone

Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doing, yeah (Worried 'bout a Xanny)

Trappin' around the world (Would you brag, or would you try to get me?)

Over the phone, dropping tears (Tell me now, I know that you be braggin')

I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you too bad, yeah)

When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)

When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)

Please tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you)

Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you)



Early in the mornin', late at night

It don't even matter what time it is

Worried 'bout a Xanny, would you brag, or would you try to get me?

Tell me now, I know that you be braggin'

Tell me now

--- 'Bad Habits' by Ed Sheeran ---
(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes

And tonight I had something wonderful



My bad habits lead to late nights, endin' alone

Conversations with a stranger I barely know

Swearin' this will be the last but it probably won't

I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space

And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say

Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape

Nothin' happens aftеr two, it's true, it's true

My bad habits lead to you



Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

My bad habits lеad to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

My bad habits lead to you



Every pure intention ends when the good times start

Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark

It started under neon lights and then it all got dark

I only know how to go too far



My bad habits lead to late nights, endin' alone

Conversations with a stranger I barely know

Swearin' this will be the last but it probably won't

I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space

And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say

Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape

Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true

My bad habits lead to you



Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

My bad habits lead to you



We took the long way 'round

And burned 'til the fun ran out, now



My bad habits lead to late nights, endin' alone

Conversations with a stranger I barely know

Swearin' this will be the last but it probably won't

I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space

And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say

Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape

Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true

My bad habits lead to you



Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

--- 'Thats What I Want' by Lil Nas X ---
1, 2, 3, 4
Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight

An afro, black boy with the gold teeth

Dark skin, lookin' at me like he know me

I wonder if he got the G or the B

Let me find out and see, comin' over to me, yeah



These days I'm way too lonely

I'm missin' out, I know

These days I'm way too alone

And I'm known for giving love away but



I want someone to love me

I need somеone who needs me

'Cause it don't feel right whеn it's late at night

And it's just me in my dreams

So I want someone to love

That's what I fuckin' want



Look, you know it's harder to find in these times

But I got nothin' but love on my mind (My mind)

I need a baby with love in my prime

Need an adversary to my down to marry

Like, tell me that's life when I'm stressin' at night

Be like "You'll be okay" and "Everything's all right"

Let me up in there 'cause I'm not wantin' anything

But you're lovin' your body and a little bit of your brain



These days I'm way too lonely

I'm missin' out, I know

These days I'm way too alone

And I'm known for giving love away but



I want someone to love me

I need someone who needs me

'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night

And it's just me in my dreams

So I want someone to love

That's what I fuckin' want

I want someone to love me

I need someone who needs me

'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night

And it's just me in my dreams

So I want someone to love

That's what I fuckin' want

--- 'Enemy' by Imagine Dragons and JID ---
Look out for yourself
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I’m searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned



Tell you you’re the greatest

But once you turn, they hate us



Oh, the misery

Everybody wants to be my enemy

Spare the sympathy

Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y

(Look out for yourself)

My enemy-y-y-y-y

(Look out for yourself)

But I’m ready



Your words up on thе wall as you’rе prayin’ for my fall

And the laughter in thе halls and the namеs that I’ve been called

I stack it in my mind, and I’m waiting for the time

When I show you what it’s like to be words spit in a mic



Tell you you’re the greatest

But once you turn, they hate us (Huh)



Oh, the misery

Everybody wants to be my enemy

Spare the sympathy

Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y

(Look out for yourself)

My enemy-y-y-y-y (Yeah)

(Look out for yourself)

Uh, look, okay



I’m hoping that somebody pray for me

I’m praying that somebody hope for me

I’m staying where nobody ‘posed to be p-p-posted

Being a wreck of emotions

Ready to go whenever just let me know

The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor

The enemy’s on my trail, my energy unavailable

I’ma tell ’em, “Hasta luego”

They wanna plot on my trot to the top

I’ve been outta shape, thinkin’ out the box

I’m an astronaut

I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe

And it matters more because I had it not

Had I thought about wreaking havoc

On an opposition, kinda shockin’

They wanted static with precision

I’m automatic quarterback

I ain’t talkin’ sacking, pack it

Pack it up, I don’t panic, batter-batter up

Who the baddest?

It don’t matter ’cause we at ya throat



Everybody wants to be my enemy

Spare the sympathy

Everybody wants to be my enemy

Oh, the misery

Everybody wants to be my enemy

Spare the sympathy

Everybody wants to be my enemy



Ayo-ay, I swear I never be insane-oh-ay

My enemy

Ayo-ay, I swear I never be insane

(Look out for yourself)

--- 'ABCDEFU' by Gayle ---
I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection

It's like you'd do anything for my affection

You're goin' all about it in the worst ways



I was into you, but I'm over it now

And I was tryna be nice

But nothing's getting through, so let me spеll it out



A-B-C-D-E, fuck you

And your mom and your sister and your job

And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art

Fuck you and your friends that I'll nеver see again

Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off



Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah-nah

A-B-C-D-E, fuck you



You said you just needed space and so I gave it

When I had nothin' to say you couldn't take it

Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it

Always had to put yourself above me



I was into you, but I'm over it now

And I was tryna be nice

But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out



A-B-C-D-E, fuck you

And your mom and your sister and your job

And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds

Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again

Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off



Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah-nah

A-B-C-D-E, fuck off

Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah-nah

A-B-C-D-E, fuck you



And your mom and your sister and your job

And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art

Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again

Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

--- 'Wasted on You' by Morgan Wallen ---
I don’t always wake up in the morning
Pour myself a strong one
Aw but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burning
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can’t keep leanin’ on you



Looks like I’m learning the hard way again

It’s all my fault

Yeah, I dropped the ball

You’re gone and I’ve gone 3 sheets to the wind

Just thinking ’bout all I’ve wasted on you



All of this time and all of this money

All of the these sorries I don’t owe you honey

All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew

All them days I spent, wasted on you

(wasted on you)



Yeah, I swore this would be different

My heart wouldn’t listen to my head and these boots on my feet



Looks like I’m learning the hard way again

That’s why I’ve been:



Wasted on you

All of this time, and all of this money and all these sorries I don’t owe you, honey

All of these miles on this chevy and prayers in a pew

All them days I spent, wasted on you

(Wasted on you)



Like the pile of your stuff that’s packed up in the back, right down to the strike of this match

Wasted on you

(Wasted on you, Wasted on you)



All of this time, and all of this money and all these sorries I don’t owe you, honey

All of these miles on this chevy and prayers in a pew

All them nights I spent, Wasted on you, wasted on you

(wasted on you, wasted on you)

Si tú me lo pide', yo me porto bonito

--- 'We Don't Talk About Bruno' by Carolina Gaitán, Mauro Castillo, Adassa, Rhenzy Feliz, Diane Guerrero, Stephanie Beatriz and the Encanto cast ---
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno, but
It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready

And there wasn't a cloud in the sky

No clouds allowed in the sky

Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin

Thunder

You telling this story or am I?

I'm sorry, mi vida, go on

Bruno says, "It looks like rain"

Why did he tell us?

In doing so, he floods my brain

Abuela, get the umbrellas

Married in a hurricane

What a joyous day but anyway



We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no

We don't talk about Bruno



Hey, grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling

I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling

I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch ch ch

It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling

Always left Abuela and the family fumbling

Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand

Do you understand?

A seven-foot frame, rats along his back

When he calls your name it all fades to black

Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams (Hey)



We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no

We don't talk about Bruno



He told me my fish would die, the next day, dead (No, no)

He told me I'd grow a gut and just like he said (No, no)

He said that all my hair would disappear, now, look at my head (No, no)

Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read



He told me that the life of my dreams

Would be promised, and someday be mine

He told me that my power would grow

Like the grapes that thrive on the vine (Óye, Mariano's on his way)

He told me that the man of my dreams

Would be just out of reach

Betrothed to another

It's like I hear him, now

Hey sis, I want not a sound out of you

It's like I can hear him now, I can hear him, now



Um, Bruno

Yeah, about that Bruno

I really need to know about Bruno

Gimme the truth and the whole truth, Bruno (Isabela, your boyfriend's here)

Time for dinner

A seven-foot frame, rats along his back (It was my wedding day, it was our wedding day )

When he calls your name it all fades to black (We were getting ready and there wasn't a cloud in the sky)

Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin)

You telling this story or am I?



Óye, Mariano's on his way

Bruno says, "It looks like rain" (He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach)

In doing so, he floods my brain (Betrothed to another, another)

Married in a hurricane (And I'm fine, and I'm fine, and I'm fine, I'm fine)

He's here

Don't talk about Bruno, no

Brand new nigga with the same old team

Now he got me on a leash 'cause he said no strings



You know I'm cool with that

Stole the pussy, you ain't get sued for that (Sued)

Wonder what a nigga might do for that?

I could be your Chaka, where Rufus at? (Where?)

You'on mind and you know I like you for that

--- 'You Proof' by Morgan Wallen ---
Yeah, I've been throwin' down the whiskey
I ought to get my money back
Someone said it drowns the memory
Aw, but it ain't doin' jack
Yeah, I've been sippin', I've been buzzin'
Shootin' doubles like it's nothin'

Aw, but nothin' makes you go away



I need something "You proof"

Something stronger than I'm used to

Yeah, I've been pullin' 90 to 100

Feel like nothing's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth

Yeah, I need something "You proof"

Aw, I need something "You proof"



Poured 'em up 'til they're shutting 'em down, yeah

You never ain't not around, yeah

Don't matter what time or town, I can't get you gone

Turned the bar, yeah, upside down

Just lookin' for somethin' that does it

I'd give up all my money



Ain't nobody sellin' nothin' "You proof"

Something stronger than I'm used to

Yeah, I've been pullin' 90 to 100

Feel like nothing's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth

Yeah, I need something "You proof"

Aw, I need something "You proof"



Hey, I've been mixing liquors tryin' to get you gone

Aw, but I must be doing somethin' wrong

'Cause I've been working hard to fade your memory

Baby, but the only thing faded is me



I need something "You proof"

Something stronger than I'm used to

Yeah, I've been pullin' 90 to 100

Feel like nothing's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth

I need something "You proof" (Poured 'em up 'til they're shutting 'em down, yeah)

Aw, I need something "You proof" (You never ain't not around, yeah)



Don't matter what time or town, I can't get you gone

Turned the bar, yeah, upside down

Just lookin' for somethin' that does it

I'd give up all my money

Ain't nobody sellin' nothin' "You proof"

What you, ooh, uh, what you do?
Made a move, coulda made a move

If I knew I'd be with you

Is it too late to pursue?



I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit

Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it

Thought you were too good for me, my dear

Never gave me time of day, my dear

It's okay, things happen for

Reasons that I think are sure, yeah



I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me (I wish I knew)

I wish I knew (Oh), I wish I knew you wanted me

I wish I knew (Yeah), I wish I knew you wanted me (Oh)

Please say to me (Please, just say to me)

If you still wanna

I wish you wouldn't play with me

I wanna know (Oh, no)



Uh, can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?

Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?

No, you're not too good for me, my dear

Funny you come back to me, my dear

It's okay, things happen for

Reasons that I can't ignore, yeah

You got me stuck on the thought of you

You're making me feel brand new

You're more than a sunshine in my eyes



You got those pretty eyes in your head, you know it

You got me dancing in my bed so let me show it

You are exactly what I want, kinda cool and kinda not

Wanna give myself to you



Yeah, we're driving down the freeway at night

I only got one thing in the back of my mind

Na-na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na-na, oh no
Yeah, yeah
Said you love me, but I don't care
That I broke my hand on the same wall

That you told me that he fucked you on (Oh)

You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings

I got one comin' over and one right now (Uh)

One right now

(One right now, one right now, oh)

I got one comin' over and one right now



Said you wanna have my babies

I fucked you so good, you should pay me

Don't call me "baby" when you did me so wrong

(When you did me so wrong)

But I got over what you did already

Body for a body, so petty

How many of your friends fit in my Rolls? (Can you fit in my Rolls?)

Bought you a new face, you should call me "Dad," baby

Hermès, but you dropped the bag, baby

Truth is, maybe one's just not еnough

[Chorus: Post Malone & The Weeknd]

You say you love me, but I don't care

That I brokе my hand on the same wall

That you told me that he fucked you on (That he fucked you on)

You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings (Feelings)

I got one comin' over and one right now (Uh)

I got one comin' over and one right now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

(One right now, one right now, oh)

I got one comin' over and one right now



You're a stain on my legacy

We can't be friends, can't be family (Oh)

You probably fuck all my enemies (Oh)

I can't let you be next to me

Oh, you belong to the world now

So just me leave me alone now

We're not in touch no more



You say you love me, but I don't care (No, I don't care)

That I broke my hand on the same wall

That you told me that he fucked you on (Oh)

You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings (Feelings)

I got one comin' over and one right now

One right now (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)

--- 'Numb Little Bug' by Em Beihold ---
I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're out of touch
I've been driving in LA
And the world it feels too big

Like a floating ball that's bound to break

Snap my psyche like a twig



And I just wanna see

If you feel the same as me



Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?

Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die

Like you're hanging by a thread but you gotta survive

'Cause you gotta survive

Like your body's in the room but you're not really there

Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care

Like you're fresh out of love but it's been in the air

Am I past repair?



A little bit tired of tryin’ to care when I don’t

A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope

A little bit tired of sinkin’

There’s water in my boat

I’m barely breathin’

Tryna stay afloat

So I got these quick repairs to cope

Guess I’m just broken and broke



The prescriptions on its way

With a name I can’t pronounce

And the dose I gotta take

Boy I wish that I could count



'Cause I just wanna see

If this could make me happy



Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?

Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die

Like you're hanging by a thread but you gotta survive

'Cause you gotta survive

Like your body's in the room but you're not really there

Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care

Like you're fresh out of love but it's been in the air

Am I past repair?



A little bit tired of tryin’ to care when I don’t

A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope

A little bit tired of sinkin’

There’s water in my boat

I’m barely breathin’

Tryna stay afloat

So I got these quick repairs to cope

Guess I’m just broken and broke



Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?

Like you’re not really happy but you don’t wanna die

Like a numb little bug that’s gotta survive

That’s gotta survive

Just awaken shaken once again, so you know it's on
Just awaken shaken once again, ho, you know it's on
Just awaken shaken once again, so you know it's on
Just awaken shaken once again, ho, you know it's on
Yeah, life
Life is the only thing we need

They need me to go, but I don't wanna leave

Rest in peace to Lil Keed



Fuck a pigeonhole, I'm a night owl, this a different mode

I might have to make her paint a 6 on her pinky toe

Heard you with a shooting guard, just let a nigga know

I would have you courtside, not the middle row

All good, love, in a minute, though

I can't strеss about no bitch 'cause I'm a timid soul

Plus I'm cookin' up ambition on a kitchen stove

Pot start to bubblе, see the suds, that shit good to go

Hoes say I'm suave, but I can't get RICO'd

Bro think he John Wayne, I bought him yellow stones

Love the way they hang, babe, fuck the silicone

Everybody fake now, you could crack the code

Bustdown everything, set in rose gold

Dread talkin' to you niggas like I'm J. Cole

I can tell her head good before I even know

Bitch, don't tell me that you model if you ain't been in Vogue

Gotta throw a party for my day ones

They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'

Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'

You don't like the way I talk? Nigga, say somethin'

Gotta throw a party for my day ones

Pull up and you know it's us, the bass jumpin'

You don't like the way I talk? Then say somethin'

Get out my face, nigga



Gotta throw a party for my day ones

They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'

Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'

If I let my nigga 21 tell it, you a

Pussy



Spin a block twice like it ain't nowhere to park (21)

Smack the backside of his head like he Bart (Pussy)

OVO 4L, we come out when it get dark (21, 21)

Big stepper, he came in a Rolls, but he left in a stretcher (21)

Let my brother drive while I shoot, team effort (21)

Askin' all these questions, bitch, you must think you Nadeska

The chopper like to feel on all the opps, it's a molester (21)

I be with my gun like Rozay be with lemon pepper

She wanna hear some Afrobeats 'cause she just popped a Tesla

All that workin' out, that nigga must think he a wrestler

But this ain't UFC, this chopper came with a compressor (21)

This chopper came with a compressor (Pussy)

This chopper came with a— (Pussy)

This Glock 45 came with a switch (21)

If I was Will Smith, I would've slapped him with a stick

Put your hands in the air, it's a stick-up (21)

Spin the same hood where I get my dick sucked (Facts)

If you standin' on business, put your blick up (21, 21)

Come around actin' scary, get your shit took (21)

Fell in love with feelin' dizzy, so I spizzin (21)

I got mad love for the boy, yeah, that's my twizzin (21)

If them niggas keep on dissin', slide agaizzin (21)

We the reason why the opps ain't got no frizziends (21)

Last nigga played with me got turned duppy

I ain't even roll him in the 'Wood 'cause he musty

You ask how she doin', I just tell her come and fuck me

Shot his ass twenty times, damn, this nigga lucky (Damn, that nigga lucky)



Gotta throw a party for my day ones

They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'

Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'

You don't like the way I talk, nigga, say somethin'



Say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin'

You don't like the way I talk, nigga, say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin'

--- ''Til You Can't' by Cody Johnson ---
You can tell your old man you'll do some large-mouth fishin' another time
You just got too much on your plate to bait and cast a line
You can always put a rain check in his hand
'Til you can't
You can keep puttin' off forever with that girl who's heart you hold

Swearin' that you'll ask someday further down the road

You can always put a diamond on her hand

'Til you can't



If you got a chance take it

Take it while you got a chance

If you got a dream chase it

'Cause a dream won't chase you back

If you're gonna love somebody

Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can

'Til you can't



There's a box of greasy parts sittin' in the trunk of that sixty-five

Still waitin' on you and your grandad to bring it back to life

You can always get around to fixin' up that Pontiac

'Til you can't



If you got a chance take it

Take it while you got a chancе

If you got a dream chase it

'Cause a drеam won't chase you back

If you're gonna love somebody

Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can

'Til you can't



So take that phone call from your mama

Just talk away

'Cause you'll never know how bad you wanna

'Til you can't some day

Don't wait on tomorrow 'cause tomorrow may not show

Say your sorry's, I love you's

'Cause, man, you never know



If you got a chance take it

Take it while you got a chance

If you got a dream chase it

'Cause a dream won't chase you back

If you're gonna love somebody

Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can

'Til you can't

Yeah, if you got a chance take it (Take it)

Take it while you got a chance

If you got a dream chase it

'Cause a dream won't chase you back

If you're gonna love somebody

Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can

'Til you can't

Aye

She's so low maintenance
Don't need no champagne poppin' entertainment
Take her to Wendy's
Can't keep her off me

She wanna dip me like them fries in her Frosty



But every now and then when I get paid

I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade

Aye, aye, aye



Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night

Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake

Get some whipped cream on the top too

Two straws, one check, girl, I got you

Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam

Squeak-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home

Some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight

Aye, that's how we do, how we do, fancy like, oh

(Fancy like an oh)

Fancy like an oh



Don't need no Tesla to impress her

My girl is happy rollin' on a Vespa (There she go)

Don't need no mansion to get romancin' (No mansion, woo)

She's super fine, double wide, slow dancin' (Slow dancin')



But every now and then when I get paid

I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade

Aye, aye, aye



Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (That's right)

Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (Aye)

Get some whipped cream on the top too (Gotta add that whipped cream)

Two straws, one check, girl, I got you (Girl, I got you)

Some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight

Aye, that's how we do, how we do, fancy like



My new, clean blue jeans without the holes in 'em

Country kisses on my lips without Skoal in 'em

Yeah, she probably gon' be keeping some Victoria's Secrets

Maybe a little Maybelline but she don't need it

In the kitchen light radio slows down

Boxed wine and her up-do goes down



Aye

Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (That's right)

Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (Aye)

Get some whipped cream on the top too (Gotta add that whipped cream)

We've been burnin' both ends
Keepin' the lights on
So I've been thinkin' we need
A little time alone
So what you say we cancel our plans?

Tonight I'm only gonna be your man



Let's get some candles burning

And some records turning

All the lights down low

Take it nice and slow

The way your body's moving

Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long

Writin' our love song

Girl, I want it, gotta have it

Let the passion take us to a higher place

Makin' the kind of love we make



There ain't no way, baby

To get me out this house

When you look this good

What could I even think about? Oh, oh



Besides turning 'round and locking the door

Watchin' your red dress fall to the floor



Let's get some candles burning

And some records turning

All the lights down low

Take it nice and slow

The way your body's moving

Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long

Writin' our love song

Girl, I want it, gotta have it

Let the passion take us to a higher place

Makin' the kind of love we make

I'm living like I'm nine-zeros

Got no regrets even when I am broke (Yeah)

I'm at my best when I got something I'm wanting to steal

Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel (Yeah, yeah)

No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal

I'll take it in and let it go

If you don't think it, you won't be it

That love ain't yours (Can't break my soul)

Tryin' to fake it, never makes it

That, we all know (Can't break my soul)

You can have the stress and not take less

I'll justify love

We go round in circles, round in circles

Searchin' for love (Round in circles)

We go up and down, lost and found

Searchin' for love

Looking for something that lives inside me

Looking for something that lives inside me



You won't break my soul

You won't break my soul

You won't break my soul

You won't break my soul

I'm tellin' everybody

Tellin' everybody

Everybody

You won't break my soul

You won't break my soul, no, no

You won't break my soul

You won't break my soul

And I'm tellin' everybody (Oh yeah, yeah)

Everybody (Oh yeah, yeah)

Everybody

Everybody (Oh yeah, yeah)



I'm takin' my new salvation

And I'ma build my own foundation, yeah

Got motivation (Motivation)

I done found me a new foundation, yeah (New foundation)

I'm takin' my new salvation (New salvation)

And I'ma build my own foundation, yeah (Own foundation)



I'm 'bout to explode, take off this load

Bend it, bust it open, won’t ya make it go

Yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka

Yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka (Release ya wiggle)

Yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka, yaka

Release ya wiggle

Release ya anger, release ya mind

Release ya job, release the time

Release ya trade, release the stress

Release the love, forget the rest

--- 'Levitating' by Dua Lipa ---
If you wanna run away with me
I know a galaxy and I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like

If you feel like you need a little bit of company

You met me at the perfect time



You want me, I want you, baby

My sugarboo, I'm levitating

The milky way, we're renegading

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)



I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight

I need you, all night

Come on, dance with me

(I'm levitating)

You, moonlight, you're my starlight

I need you, all night

Come on, dance with me

(I'm levitating)



I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy

I see us written in the stars

We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never

Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far



Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes

Shining just the way we are

I feel like we're forever, every time we get together

But whatever, let's get lost on mars



You want me, I want you, baby

My sugarboo, I'm levitating

The milky way, we're renegading

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)



I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight

I need you, all night

Come on, dance with me

(I'm levitating)

You, moonlight, you're my starlight

I need you, all night

Come on, dance with me

(I'm levitating)



You can fly away with me tonight

You can fly away with me tonight

Baby, let me take you for a ride

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

(I'm levitating)

You can fly away with me tonight

You can fly away with me tonight

Baby, let me take you for a ride

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)



My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off

And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off

And even if I wanted to, I can't stop

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off

And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off

And even if I wanted to, I can't stop

--- 'In a Minute' by Lil Baby ---
Damn Kai, you goin' crazy
I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?

Still runnin' 'round with mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard

People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet

Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet

Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time

Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em

Only thing they should be sayin' is, "Baby keep it solid"

We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided

Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence

I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it

She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her

Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league

I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?

Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's

Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe

Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy

Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly

Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta

I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo

Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo

Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so

This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh

Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, "Lay low"

C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco

AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco



I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs

I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real

Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years

And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs

I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real

Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years

And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal



Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation

Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location

Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation

Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation

Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at

Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at

Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach

Pull up like your mama with the switch, "Why the fuck would you say that?”

You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back

Condo to get off, I was always taught, "Don't tell hoes where you stay at"

Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at

Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that

Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that

Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back

Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at



I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs

I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real

Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years

And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs

I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real

Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years

And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

I got a man but, I want you

You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face

And it don't work, you see through

That I just want to get with you



And you're right

You right, I got my guy

But I, I can't help it, I want you

Said, you right, I got my guy

But I, I can't help it, I want you



I can't stop and look the other way

'Cause I know it could be, babe, and you never feel the same

You'd be thinkin' 'bout it every day

Don't believe in fairytales, but we got our fantasies

And it's me and you, no she

Tryna be all through your sheets

Have you all on top of me

Actin' like it's not that deep

Boy, you can take it off of me

Tell me what it's 'bout to be

Really feel it's bound to bе

I can't tell no one, but they all know

--- 'She Had Me at Heads Carolina' by Cole Swindell ---
(Heads Carolina, tails California)
I was out with the boys, catchin' up in a neon light
Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic

One of 'em walked up and turned in her name

Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'



"Heads Carolina, tails California"

Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia

She's got the bar in the palm of her hand

And she's a '90s country fan like I am

Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter

I'd drive hеr anywhere from herе to California

When this song is over, I gotta find her

'Cause she had me at "Heads Carolina"



Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no

I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah

She had me down in the front by the end of verse two

Like there wasn't no one else in the room, we were singin'



"Heads Carolina, tails California"

Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia

She's got the bar in the palm of her hand

And she's a '90s country fan like I am

Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter

I'd drive her anywhere from here to California

When this song is over, I gotta find her

'Cause she had me at "Heads Carolina"



Yeah, I bought her a round and we talked 'til the lights came on

I still see that girl every time I hear that song



"Heads Carolina, tails California"

Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia

She's got the bar in the palm of her hand

And she's a '90s country fan like I am

Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter

I'd drive her anywhere from here to California

When this song is over, I gotta find her

'Cause she had me at "Heads Carolina"



(Heads Carolina, tails California)

Yeah, she had me at "Heads Carolina" (Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer)

(Heads Carolina, tails California)

Yeah (Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer)

(Heads Carolina)

(Somewhere together, I've got a quarter)

Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog

Player getting valeted around in that ho whip

Two fingers, set one down on my toes ten

Flewed out, my boobs out, put a cork in it

Love it when you be cryin' out when I'm corseted

I don't think you gon' make it

Do not let me start ragin'

Bitch, I'm losin' my patience

This ain't stayin' in Vegas (You ain't nothing but a)



There's more sides to the story, I'ma tell everybody

Had your ass sittin' courtside with your arm around me

Had your ass sittin' first class with your burnt ass out in Abu Dhabi

Could've been what we should've been but you lost a bet, now you gotta find me

Find a seat, nigga

I ain't playin' this hide and seek

High school when you finally peaked

Hound dog, come find a treat

I'm a bad bitch but (You ain't nothing but a)

Yeah, yeah, I said (You ain't nothing but a)

I get it, I know you got some other shit you wanted

I get it, you needed someone that could prove you wrong

So I reckon, you leave all of your problems at the door to my city

You gon' need to tell my brothers where you from

And I admit it, I still got empathy

And you gon' feel it for two weeks

When I release you in them streets

And keep my meaning discrete

Keep the clean in my Jeep

And put that Yeezy in your teeth

Let my bitches off they leashes

If you even think to speak

I'ma give a whole new meaning

When you said you live in a dream

We can keep that shit asleep

And you gon' laugh with all your Gs

Countin' them sheep, sheep, sheep

Talkin' 'bout Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z, R-I-P

--- 'Buy Dirt' by Jordan Davis and Luke Bryan ---
Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said, what you been up to lately
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out

Said if you want my two cents on making a dollar count



Buy dirt

Find the one you can’t live without

Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground

Do what you love but call it work

And throw a little money in the plate at church

Send some prayers up and your roots down deep

Add a few limbs to your family tree

And watch their pencils marks

And the grass in the yard

All grow up

‘Cause the truth about it is

It all goes by real quick

You can’t buy happiness

But you can buy dirt



Before you get caught on that ladder

Let me tell you what it’s all about

Find you a few things that matter

That you can put a fence around

And then he laid it out



Buy dirt

Find the one you can’t live without

Get ring, let your knee hit the ground

Do what you love but call it work

And throw a little money in the plate at church

Send some prayers up and your roots down deep

And add a few limbs to your family tree

And watch their pencils marks

And the grass in the yard

All grow up

‘Cause the truth about it is

It all goes by real quick

You can’t buy happiness

But you can buy dirt



You can buy dirt



And thank the good Lord for it

‘Cause He ain’t makin’ any more of it



Buy dirt

Find the one you can’t live without

Get ring, let your knee hit the ground

Do what you love but call it work

And throw a little money in the plate at church

Send some prayers up and your roots down deep

Add a few limbs to your family tree

Watch their pencils marks

And the grass in the yard

All grow up

‘Cause the truth about it is

It all goes by real quick

You can’t buy happiness

But you can buy dirt

--- 'I Hate U' by SZA ---
I be so sick of you niggas, y'all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Tripping 'bout your whereabouts

I can't keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?

I don't want no static with you, you know you my plug

And I can't shake this habit, no



I've been up, baby

Heavy reminiscin'

Heavy on the missin' you

Wish shit was different than what it was

I've been up, baby

Lost in the lie of us

Lost, ain't no findin' us

I've been up, baby



And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)

Shitty of you to make me feel just like this

What I would do to make you feel just like this

And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)

Shitty of you to make mе feel just like this

What I would do to make you feel just like this



Usеd to be too solid 'til you scrambled me

Used to be your rider, you mishandle me

Used to be nonviolent 'til you ambushed me

Now I'm out here wildin' with you

Now I'm out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (No)

Missionary gettin' boring, can you switch positions? (Yeah)

Hard to save your soul, you don't ever listen, no (No)



I've been up, baby

Heavy reminiscin'

Heavy on the missin' you

Wish shit was different than what it was

--- 'Boyfriend' by Dove Cameron ---
I can't believe we're finally alone
I can't believe I almost went home
What are the chances? Everyone's dancing
And he's not with you (Hm, hm, hm, hm)
The universe must have divined us

What am I gonna do?

Not gonna grab your wrist?



I could be a better boyfriend than him

I could do the shit that he never did

Up on that, I won't quit

Thinking about how you could stay away from him

I could be such a gentleman

Plus all my clothes would fit



Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I could be a better boyfriend



I don't need to tell you twice

All the ways he can't sufficе

If I could give you some advice

I would lеave with me tonight



The universe must have divined us

Hm, hm, hm, hm

Ladies first, baby, I insist



I could be a better boyfriend than him

I could do the shit that he never did

Up on that, I won't quit

Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him

I could be such a gentleman

Plus all my clothes would fit



Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I could be a better boyfriend than him

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I could be a better boyfriend



I never would've left you alone

Here on your own

Go to your phone

Never would've left you alone

For someone else to take you home



I could be a better boyfriend than him

I could do the shit that he never did

Up on that, I won't quit

I'm gonna steal you from him

I could be such a gentleman

Plus you know my clothes would fit

I could be a better boyfriend than him

I could do the shit that he never did

Up on that, I won't quit

Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him

--- 'Glimpse of Us' by Joji ---
She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if she's so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?

Perfect don't mean that it's workin'

So what can I do? (Ooh)



When you're out of sight

In my mind



'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes

And that's where I find a glimpse of us

And I try to fall for her touch

But I'm thinkin' of the way it was

Said I'm fine and said I moved on

I'm only here passing time in her arms

Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us



Tell me he savors your glory

Does he laugh the way I did?

Is this a part of your story?

One that I had never lived

Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely

And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse

Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again



When you're out of sight

In my mind



'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes

And that's where I find a glimpse of us

And I try to fall for her touch

But I'm thinkin' of the way it was

Said I'm fine and said I moved on

I'm only here passing time in her arms

Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us



Ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh



'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes

And that's where I find a glimpse of us

And I try to fall for her touch

But I'm thinkin' of the way it was

Said I'm fine and said I moved on

I'm only here passing time in her arms

Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

--- 'Surface Pressure' by Jessica Darrow ---
I'm the strong one
I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the earth is
I move mountains
I move churches

And I glow 'cause I know what my worth is



I don't ask how hard the work is

Got a rough, indestructible surface

Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em

I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but



Under the surface

I feel berserk as a tightrope walking in a three-ring circus

Under the surface

Was Hercules ever like “Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus?”



Under the surface

I'm pretty surе I'm worthless is I can't be of servicе

A flaw or a crack

The straw in the stack

That breaks the camel's back

What breaks the camel's back?



It's pressure like a drip, drip, drip, that'll never stop, whoa

Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip till you just go pop, whoa-uh-uh

Give it to your sister, your sister's older

Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder

Who am I if I can't run with the ball?

If I fall to



Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa

Pressure like a tick, tick, tick till it's ready to blow, whoa-uh-uh

Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger

See if she can hang on a little longer

Who am I if I can't carry it all?

If I falter

--- 'Fall in Love' by Bailey Zimmerman ---
Heard you moved out to South Carolina
Just like you always said we would
Packed your bags in that old 4Runner
That I bought you when things were good
I'm glad to see the stop sign didn't hit ya
Bring you back to your senses

Oh, it waved you gone, goodbye

Yeah, it waved you gone, goodbye



I heard you found yourself a brand new man

Put a rock on your finger and he vowed you a second chance

Built a house right by the coast

That ocean view is beautiful, but baby, I just want you to know

He don't know you like I did

Money talks, but I ain't buyin'



'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger

One second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone

A broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony

My confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah

You don't wanna fall in love

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah

You don't wanna fall in love



I seen your mama walkin' out the county market

And I thought to ask her how she's been

Said she's missin' ya and tried to go convincin' ya

Not to settle down with him

She ain't wrong, the whole town knows it

You had a bed of roses, but girl, you couldn't walk that line

You can act like you're doin' fine



'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger

One second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone

A broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony

My confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah

You don't wanna fall in love

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah

You don't wanna fall in love





'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger

One second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone

A broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony

My confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah

You don't wanna fall in love

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah

You don't wanna fall in love

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah

You don't wanna fall in love

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah



Heard you moved out to South Carolina

Just like you always said we would

--- 'Super Freaky Girl' by Nicki Minaj ---
She's alright
That girl's alright with me
Yeah
Ay, yo

I can lick it, I can ride it

While you slippin' and slidin'

I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it

You can smack it, you can grip it

You can go down and kiss it

And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it

He want a F-R-EEEEE-A-K

F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K

EEEEE-A-K

F-R-EEEEE-A-K



One thing about me, I'm the baddest alive

He know the prettiest bitch didn't come until I arrive

I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try

I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind

They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try

A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive

His ex bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive

On applications I write, "Pressure", 'cause that's what I apply (Brrrr)

Pressure applied, can't fuck a regular guy

Wetter than umbrellas and stickier than Apple Pie



I can lick it, I can ride it

While you slippin' and slidin'

I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it

You can smack it, you can grip it

You can go down and kiss it

And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it

He want a F-R-EEEEE-A-K

F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K

EEEEE-A-K

F-R-EEEEE-A-K



'Cause what the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga, custom down?

Like, what the fuck, this ain't Burberry, custom brown?

He said, "Could you throw it back while you touch the ground?"

Then he said, "Do that pussy purr?" I said, "Yup, meow"

Hold up, fuck boys, ain't no need for you to roll up

Ain't no need for you to double tap neither, scroll up

Keep these bitches on they toes like Manolo

Be on the lookout when I come through, BOLO

Oh, whoa

Elegant bitch with a hoe glow

If it ain't big, then I won't blow

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe

Fuck is the tea? I just F'd a G

Make him say "Uhh", just ask Master P

Ball so hard, I just took a knee

Get me Rocky A$AP, nigga, word to RIH



Freak

F-f-freak

Some gyal a freak

Gyal a freak

Gyal a freak, freak, freak, freak



I can lick it, I can ride it

While you slippin' and slidin'

I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it

You can smack it, you can grip it

You can go down and kiss it

And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it

He want a F-R-EEEEE-A-K

F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K

--- 'Hrs and Hrs' by Muni Long ---
Yours, mine, ours
I could do this for hours
Sit and talk to you for hours
I wanna give you your flowers
And some champagne showers
Order shrimp and lobster towers

But it's me that gets devoured

Ooh



When you do what you do, I'm empowered

You give me a super power

Together the world could be ours

You sit me up on the counter

Instantly, it's thundershowers

Storming for a couple hours

When we finish, take a shower



I could do this for hours

And hours, and hours

I could do this for hours

And hours, and hours

I could do this for hours

And hours, and hours

I could do this for hours

And hours, and hours



I, usually don't like nobody

And when I say nobody I mean nobody

All these niggas full of shit

You just the homie once they hit

Felt like giving up on love

These niggas almost made me quit



Then I met you

When I met you I knew this was it

I've never been in love like this

A love like ours, I prayed for it on my knees

Every night for some hours and hours

And hours and hours and hours, and hours

I could do this for hours and hours and hours

I could do this for hours and hours and hours

What's yours is mine and ours

And yours mine and ours



I can sit and talk to you for hours

Sit and look at you for hours

Making love to you for hours

Laying on your chest for hours

Telling you jokes for hours

Holding you close for hours and hours and hours

--- 'Sand in My Boots' by Morgan Wallen ---
She asked me where I was from
I said "somewhere you never been to"
Little town outside of Knoxville
Heading by some dogwood trees
She tried talking with my accent
We held hands and waded into

That blue water

She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach



But, now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado

Like a heart-broke Desperado, heading right back to my roots

Something 'bout the way she kissed me tеlls me she loves Eastеrn Tennessee

Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots



I said "let's go shoot tequila"

So we walked back to that beach bar

She said "don't cowboys drink whiskey?"

So we drank Bottom Shelf

She said "damn, that sky looks perfect"

I said "girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home"

And she said "maybe I should, see them for myself"



Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado

Like a heart-broke Desperado, heading right back to my roots

Something 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she loves Eastern Tennessee

Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots



I said meet me in the morning

And she told me I was crazy

Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up



Oh, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado

Like a heart-broke Desperado, heading right back to my roots

Something 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she loves Eastern Tennessee

Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

--- 'Knife Talk' by Drake featuring  Savage and Project Pat ---
I gotta feed the streets, my pistol gon' bleed the streets
Ski mask on my face, sometimes you got to cheat
To stay ahead in this bitch-ard (Gang), drank syrup like it's liquor
Street life'll have you catchin' up to God quicker (Yeah, gang)
Sticker, AK-40 to your liver
Let the chopper bang on you like a Blood or a Cripper (Gang)

Flipper, so much bread, I'm a gymnast

Made so much money off of dummies, off of dummies (Yeah, gang)



I'm mister body catcher, Slaughter Gang soul snatcher

Ain't no regular F-150, this a fuckin' Raptor

No capper, street nigga, not a rapper

Chopper hit him and he turned into a booty clapper

Smith & Wesson, I'm 4L Gang reppin'

We done baptized morе niggas than the damn reverеnd (Yeah)

Kappa Alpha, me and my gang, we do all the steppin'

Who you checkin'? This FN shoot East to West End (Gang)



Yeah

I heard Papi outside

And he got the double-R droppy outside

Checked the weather and it's gettin' real oppy outside

I'ma drop this shit and have these pussies droppin' like some motherfuckin'—

Type of nigga that can't look me in the eyes

I despise

When I see you, better put that fuckin' pride to the side

Many times, plenty times, I survived

Beef is live, spoiler alert, this nigga dies



Keep blickies, and you know the weed sticky

My finger itchy, the Glock like to leave hickeys

Your shooters iffy, a street punk could never diss me

I come straight up out the 6, and we don't spare sixties



I fuck with her, and fuck with her, and her

I hit up err and tell him do the err, for sure

Voodoo curse, it got him while I flew to Turks

Know the dogs had to hit them where we knew it hurts



Gang shit, that's all I'm on (Yeah)

Gang shit, that's all I'm on

Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on

Gang shit, that's all I'm on

Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on

Gang shit, that's all I'm on

Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on

Gang shit, that's all I'm on



Let it bang, bang, let it bang, bang

'Til his brains hang and his mama sang

And the pastor sang and them bullets sang

And them choppers sang and the choir sang



I'm on everything

Jacob charged me four-fifty for a tennis chain

US Open, had it on us at the tennis game

Tell the coach don't take me out, I like to finish games

And my pen insane, and my men insane

There's like eighty of us now, that's the scary thing

Shit they doin' on that other side embarrassing

We in Paris with it, hundred carats with it

All this shit is for my son, 'cause he's inheritin' it



If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

Gang

Metro



Gang shit, that's all I'm on

Gang shit, that's all I'm on

Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on

Gang shit, that's all I'm on

Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on

Gang shit, that's all I'm on

Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on

Gang shit, that's all I'm on, yeah

--- 'AA' by Walker Hayes ---
One, two, three
Coffee cup, cold and black
Wish you had a little shot of jack
Besides that, can't complain
Just tryin' to do the dang thing

Might change the oil in my truck

I ain't payin' no thirty-five bucks

Kids need shoes, mama needs Levi's



And I'm just tryna keep my daughters off the pole

And my sons out of jail

Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell

I'm just tryna keep my wife from figuring out

That I married up and she married way, way down

In Alabama where they love Nick Saban

Tryna write a song the local country station will play

Hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA (AA, ooh)



Well I gave up skoal and cigarettes

Now I'm just hooked on Nicorette

Trying not to be like my old man

But the older I get, the more I am

Tryna get paid and a little love made, y'all

Hey, y'all, at the end of the day, y'all

I'm just another John Deere guy (Hey)

Up on a tractor



Tryna steer my daughters off the pole

And my sons out of jail (Sons out of jail)

Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell (I don't wanna go)

I'm just tryna keep my wife from figuring out (Hey, babe, I love you)

That I married up and she married way way down (So fired up)

In Alabama where they love Nick Saban

Tryna write a song the local country station will play

Hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA (Ooh, ooh, come on, babe, right here)



Ooh-ooh-ooh, tryna stay out of AA every day

One step at a time, yeah

Life's hard, family's weird

Sometimes you just need a beer

Can I get an Amen? (Amen)



Man, I'm just tryna keep my daughters off the pole

And my sons out of jail (Sons out of jail)

Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell (I don't wanna go)

I'm just tryna keep my wife from figuring out (Hey, babe, I love you)

That I married up and she married way way down (So fired up)

In Alabama where they love Nick Saban (Okay)

Tryna write a song the local country station will play



Hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA

Oh, hey, hey, hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA

Yes, I am

--- 'All I Want for Christmas Is You' by Mariah Carey ---
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need 
I don't care about presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree 
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true... 

All I want for Christmas 

Is you... 



I don't want a lot for Christmas 

There is just one thing I need 

I don't care about presents 

Underneath the Christmas tree 

I don't need to hang my stocking 

There upon the fireplace 

Santa Claus won't make me happy 

With a toy on Christmas day 

I just want you for my own 

More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true 

All I want for Christmas is you... 

You baby 



I won't ask for much this Christmas 

I won't even wish for snow 

I'm just gonna keep on waiting 

Underneath the mistletoe 

I won't make a list and send it 

To the North Pole for Saint Nick 

I won't even stay awake to 

Hear those magic reindeer click 

'Cause I just want you here tonight 

Holding on to me so tight 

What more can I do 

Baby all I want for Christmas is you 

You... 



All the lights are shining 

So brightly everywhere 

And the sound of children's 

Laughter fills the air 

And everyone is singing 

I hear those sleigh bells ringing 

Santa won't you bring me the one I really need - 

won't you please bring my baby to me... 



Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas 

This is all I'm asking for 

I just want to see my baby 

Standing right outside my door 

Oh I just want him for my own 

More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true 

Baby all I want for Christmas is 

You... 



All I want for Christmas is you baby... all I want for Chrismas is you baby....

--- 'Bam Bam' by Camila Cabello featuring Ed Sheeran ---
You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now, mmm
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no

Now I'm out dancin' with strangers

You could be casually datin'

Damn, it's all changin' so fast



Así es la vida, sí

Yeah, that's just life, baby

Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down

But I'm back on my feet

Así es la vida, sí

Yeah, that's just life, baby

I was barely standin', but now I'm dancin'

He's all over me (Goza)



Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam

Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam

Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam

Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam (Así es la vida)

Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Uh-huh)

Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Eh, eh, uh-huh)

Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Uh-huh)

Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam



It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out

Yeah we were riding a wave, and trying not to drown

And on the surface I held it together

But underneath, I sorta came around

Where would I be? You're all that I need

My world, baby, you hold me down

You always hold me down, but



I've been a breaker and broken

Every mistake hurts our moments

Wouldn't take anything back



Así es la vida, sí (Así es)

Yeah, that's just life, baby

--- 'Efecto' by Bad Bunny ---
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Eh-eh-eh-eh
No sé si es casualidad que yo me sienta así
Siempre que tú estás cerquita de mí
Dime qué me hiciste, qué droga me diste

Que desde aquella noche no soy igual

Tú me mira' y empiezo a sudar

Siento que puedo volar



Baby, la nota ya está haciendo efecto

Mi mundo está jodío' y me siento perfecto

Porque estás tú, aquí, moviéndote así, no pare'

Baby, tú eres mi droga, esta noche no le baje'

Porque la nota ya está haciendo efecto

Mi mundo está jodío' y me siento perfecto

Porque estás tú, aquí, moviéndote así, no pare'

Baby, tú eres mi droga, esta noche no le baje'



Esta no, esta sí

Esta no, esta sí

Esta no, esta sí

Esta no, esta sí



El gatito tuyo te perdió por negligencia

Y yo que no creo en la abstinencia

Esta noche en la cama va a haber turbulencia'

Qué rico tú mama', te vo'a dar la permanencia'

Ese totito e' la eminencia

Pa' darle tengo licencia

Desde que fuimo' a Florencia

Se puso más bicha, pero no pierde la esencia

No, no, de Carola

No, no, no, no anda sola

No, no, no le diga' "hola"

O va' a ser otro pa' la cola

Tu crico te me amola

Yo soy fan de esa popola (Mua, mua)

Más las picky, las endo, la coca y la rola (Más nada)

Eres tú quien me controla, eh (Jeje)



En tus ojo' veo el mar, mami, llévame en tu ola (Tú eres mala)

Hoy me siento bien puta, re piola, ey



Porque la nota ya está haciendo efecto

Mi mundo está jodío' y me siento perfecto

Porque estás tú, aquí, moviéndote así, no pare'

Baby, tú ere' mi droga, esta noche no le baje'

--- 'Rock and a Hard Place' by Bailey Zimmerman ---
We've been swingin’ and missin'
It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixin’
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissin'
It's just different
We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together

Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we’re better

Off with all this, but we’re caught in-between



A rock and a hard place

Red wine and mistakes

Tears rollin' down your face

When I walked out that door

That’s when I lost it

Midnight in Austin

Damn, I'm exhausted

What the hell's this all for?

Is this where it mеnds or it breaks?

Between a rock and a hard place



For thе record (Shit)

Throwin' in the towel takes some effort

So I’d rather ride it out for better weather

Together



Between a rock and a hard place

Red wine and mistakes

Tears rollin' down your face

When I walked out that door

That's when I lost it

Midnight in Austin

Damn, I'm exhausted

What the hell's this all for?

Is this where it mends or it breaks?

Between a rock and a hard place



We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together

Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we're better

Off with all this, but we're caught in-between



A rock and a hard place

Tears rollin' down your face

As I walked out that door

That's when I lost it

Midnight in Austin

Damn, I'm exhausted

What the hell's this all for?

Is this where it mends or it breaks?

How much more of this can we take?
==================================================


--- 'Doin' This' by Luke Combs ---
Someone asked me once in an interview
"What was growing up like, where'd you go to school?
And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?"
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead end job, just makin' due

With tips in a jar, my guitar and an old barstool



I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand

Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band

Singin' them same damn songs like I am now

I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage

Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins

At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town

I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this



I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day

Who was burnin' CDs just to give away

Payin' his dues if I wasn't doin' this



Five deep in a van, head full of steam

Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true

Livin' this life just like I was born to do



I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand

Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band

Singin' them same damn songs like I am now

I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage

Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins

At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town

I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this



It ain't about the fame

It ain't about the fortune

It ain't about the name

It ain't about the glory

I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about



Having a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand

Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band

Singin' them same damn songs like I am now

I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage

Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins

At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town

I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this



Someone asked me once in an interview

"What was growing up like, where'd you go to school?

And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?"

--- 'Oh My God' by Adele ---
I ain't got too much time to spend
But I make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give, good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me coming back even though I'm terrified



I know that it's wrong

But I want to have fun

Mm, yeah, ayy-ayy, ayy

Mm, yeah, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy

I know that it's wrong

Mm, yeah, ayy-ayy, ayy

Mm, yeah, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy



Oh my God, I can't believe it but out of

All the people in the world

Oh, there's nothing like a little jumping

Out of my life and into yours

Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind

'Cause this is trouble but it feels right

Dipping on the edge of heaven and hell

It's a battle I cannot fight



I'm a fool but they all think I'm blind

I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind

I don't have to explain myself to you

I'm a gown woman and I do what I want to do, ooh-ooh



I know that it's wrong

But I want to have fun

Mm, yeah, ayy-ayy, ayy

--- 'Better Days' by Neiked, Mae Muller and Polo G ---
I been feelin' lonely
I need someone to hold me
Come on baby hold me
Yeah, I been feelin' jaded
Don't know how I should play it
Tell me how to play it

Now you, you been movin' on

Let me know, can I come along?

Since you're gone

Oh, its been so long

On my own, my own, my own, my own



Living in a haze, stayin' in the shade

All I do is sit around and wait for better days

I could use a break, can I get an "Amen"?

All I do is sit around and wait for better days



Uh, uh

Can I get an "Amen"? Introverted, can't make friends

Prayed for better days, now it's three hundred K's when my day ends

Do you remember last night? 'Cause I blacked out

In that all white dress with the back out

So be careful with her heart, 'cause it's fragile

And thinkin' 'bout her past make her lash out

She with me, it ain't no worries at all

Any problem, I be there, one call

If we locked in, you my door

Feelin' you, hang pictures on my wall

Roll one, let's get high tonight

Backseat Maybach, lavish life

Chillin' with the stars like a satellite

AP on my arm and it's shinin' bright



Living in a haze, stayin' in the shade

All I do is sit around and wait for better days

I could use a break, can I get an "Amen"?

All I do is sit around and wait for better days



Sit around, sit around, sit around and wait

For better, better, better days, oh

I could use a break, oh

Better, better, better, better

For better days, oh-oh

All I do is sit around and wait for better days

Better days

All I do is sit around and wait for better days

--- 'Fingers Crossed' by Lauren Spencer-Smith ---
Introduced me to your family
Watched my favorite shows on your TV
Made me breakfast in the morning
When you got home from work
Making plans to travel 'round the world

Said we'd always put each other first

Old love songs we used to play to

Funny, now I hate you



Now I remember when you'd call me late at night

I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you

And all your daddy issues

But now I don't even miss you anymore



So I, I want all the tears back that I cried

All the hours spent giving advice

On how to write your songs

All you did was prove me wrong

When you said you loved me

Well, you must've had your fingers crossed



Shoulda paid attention to my friends

Telling me how bad it's gonna end

Always giving their opinions

Now I wish I would have listened



I could say I'm sorry but I'm not

You don't deserve the one thing that you lost



Now I remember when you'd call me late at night

And I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you

And all your daddy issues

But now I don't even miss you anymore



So I, I want all the tears back that I cried

All the hours spent giving advice

On how to write your songs

All you did was prove me wrong

When you said you loved me

Well, you must've had your fingers crossed



Your fingers crossed

(Oh, oh) your fingers crossed

(Oh, oh) oh, when you said you loved me

Well, you must've had your fingers crossed



So I, I want all the tears back that I cried

All the hours spent giving advice

On how to write your songs

All you did was prove me wrong

Wish you said you loved me

When you didn't have your fingers crossed
==================================================


--- 'All Too Well (Taylor's Version)' by Taylor Swift ---
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze

We're singing in the car getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place

And I can picture it after all these days



And I know it's long gone

And that magic's not here no more

And I might be okay

But I'm not fine at all



'Cause there we are again, on that little town street

You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me

Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well



Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed

Your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team

You tell me about your past, thinking your future was me



And I know it's long gone

And there's nothing else I could do

And I forget about you long enough

To forget why I needed to



'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night

We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light

Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all to well



And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much

But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up

Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well



And you call me up again just to break me like a promise

So casually cruel in the name of being honest

I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here

'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well



Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it

I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own

Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone



But you keep my old scarf from that very first week

'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me

You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah



'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so

Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well



Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all

Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all

It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

--- 'You Should Probably Leave' by Chris Stapleton ---
I know it ain't all that late
But you should probably leave
I recognize that look in your eyes
Yeah, you should probably leave
'Cause I know you and you know me

And we both know where this is gonna lead

You want me to say that I want you to stay

So you should probably leave

Yeah, you should probably leave



There's still time for you to finish your wine

Then you should probably leave

And it's hard to resist, alright, just one kiss

Then you should probably leave



'Cause I know you and you know me

And we both know where this is gonna lead

You want me to say that I want you to stay

So you should probably leave

Yeah, you should probably leave



Like a devil on my shoulder you keep whisperin' in my ear

And it's gettin' kinda hard for me to do the right thing here

I wanna do the right thing, baby



Sun on your skin, 6AM

And I been watchin' you sleep

And honey, I'm so afraid you're gonna wake up and say

That you should probably leave



'Cause I know you and you know me

And we both know where this is gonna lead

I want you to stay but you'll probably say

That you should probably leave

Yeah, you should probably leave

Oh, you should probably leave

Rockin' around the Christmas tree, at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see, every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feelin' when you hear

Voices singin' let's be jolly

Deck the halls with boughs of holly



Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday

Everyone dancing merrily in the new, old-fashioned way



You will get a sentimental feelin' when you hear

Voices singin' let's be jolly

Deck the halls with boughs of holly



Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday

I met her down at Aldean's

She said she that saw me walkin' in about a mile away

Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away

She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance

I said, "You don't have to join in," she said she'd take a chance

I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down

I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found

Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around



Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out

They don't love you and they only love you right now

If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home

And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)

Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave ’em alone)

Leave them Broadway girls alone



They town just told me, "Don't trust 'em"

Broadway girls a trap

They on me, they tryna finesse me

They see me with Morgan and know that I rap

My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on

I jump on a horse, she get on the back

I went to the bar to go buy her a drink

She listen to P!nk, she told me she not a rapper

I can't run out of money

The trenches love me forever

They treat me like Ed in London

Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'

Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar

She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars



Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out

They don't love you and they only love you right now

If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home

And leave them Broadway girls alone

Broadway girls, Broadway girls

Them Broadway girls alone

Broadway girls, Broadway girls

Them Broadway girls alone



Oh, think I oughta settle down

And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh

But I told 'em that I'm savage

They just tryna tell me there's



There's two things that you're gonna find out

They don't love you and they only love you right now

If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home

And leave them Broadway girls alone

Two things that you're gonna find out

They don't love you and they only love you right now

If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home

And leave them Broadway girls alone

Broadway girls, Broadway girls

Them Broadway girls alone

Broadway girls, Broadway girls

Leave them Broadway girls alone



'Lone, 'lone, Broadway girl

'Lone, 'lone, Broadway girls alone

'Lone, 'lone, Broadway girls

Broadway girls, Broadway girls alone

--- 'What Happened to Virgil' by Lil Durk featuring Gunna ---
Banger
Oh yeah, I'm finna make a banger with this one
Last time you told me you proud of me, you wasn't proud of me, you was the nigga who doubted me
I was too mad at you, you love to come kill, you my brother, that shit was a tragedy
But magically I got the strategy, I was so sick and tired of niggas keep asking me, "Who was the killers between the hood?"

Bro I'm a king, that mean we good (DJ on the beat so it's a banger)



Talked to my TT about my problems

Learned to survive, I carry my choppa

Before I was 12, I went to the doctor

Fucked on a stripper and I took me a Roxy

How you my blood and you say you gon' pop me?

Follow with loyalty, never 'bout thotties

Don't mention my name if you mention them bodies

Don't mention my name if you mention them bodies

"Stop taking drugs after sending a song"

How you gon' blame me? Y'all give him cabaña

Bitch I'm a star, gotta use condom

Don't drink Par, only like Wocka'

Sippin' on Wocka, I feel like I'm Flocka

Shit in my parker, that shit'll go blocka'

Say that I'm mean, what you mean? I caught you

Get away from her, have speed, no tossin'

Called you a bitch, I'm sorry I lost you

Head down, X pill, Percocet, off it

Bitch my phone died, pass me a charger

Ain't have a coat, walked to school in a thermal

Bitches you lookin' up to, they'll burn you

Get out my business, that shit don't concern you

I get to diggin' this shit when I learn you

I love the trenches, this shit is eternal

Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?

I wish my brother had made it out surgery

I be up thinkin', that shit do be hurtin' me

If they gon' catch me, them niggas gon' murder me (Oh no, oh)

Gave my bro twenty, he called for a burglary

I love the bitches who say they ain't hurtin' me

Never seen blood, that shit'll turn burgundy



Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?

Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?



Fresh like the first day of school, I'm a scholar

Found the solution and got some more problems

We from the sandbox, my dog since a toddler

16 year old when I shed my first chopper

Flew out of Van Nuys, landed in Opa Locka

Quit flyin' in G5, fly helicopters (Fly helicopters)

I count every blessin' and count every dollar

I'm 'bout to go factory plain

I treat all of my dogs the same

Take care all of my bitches the same

I just hope you financially sane

Never turning my back on the gang

From the A, we was taught to be brave

Had to squabble and take a few fades

Stay rock solid, you'll get through the phase

That my nigga, what happened to Virgil?

Talked to God, I don't wanna get murdered

I got style, I don't know what you heard of

You lil' pussy, you soft and fertile

Only rumors throughout my circle

Only rumors throughout my circle, oh

R.I.P. Prince, I'ma pour up some purple

600 Maybach, the one with the curtain

Young GunnaWunna, the boy bought the Birkin

I'm goin' hard, know you proud of me workin'

Ridin' round the town sippin' and swervin'

Hold it down, do this shit with a purpose

Louis down, man this shit came from Virgil

Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?



Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?

Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?

Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?

Nigga, can't even see me, I'm way in the sky
She bought a flight, nigga way in the sky
She bought a flight but I'm way outta here

She bought a flight, nigga, can't even see me

I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky

Hermès ashtray to dump my ashes

Bitch so pretty, look better than Cassie

Puffiin' on zooties and she callin' me daddy

Walkin' on shit, turn it up and not gas it

Came out the gutter, it ain't nothin' for me to swag it

Secure the bag, got a bitch, I'ma bag it

Turnin' it up, gotta make sure shit good

Park it, two mil' in the middlе of my hood

Drinkin' on mud, I made it out of the sewеr

Chrome Heart accessories, whatever, I'm good

Lot of these niggas, they lookin' the same

They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain

Championship, championship, Range just gon' amp this shit

Bitch break her neck just to look at the kid



Dirty the Fanta but make it in Canada

Bro get this money like it's my religion

It's gon' be a mad day, a sad day for any of these niggas

That try to compare whatever I did

Damn near touched a hundred, it just off the gig

I came out the jungle, they kidnapped a kid

I trap out a bando, spent ten on a crib

I look at the ocean to spot thirty M's

Pin it where I'm at, the city I'm in

I give you my fully, no matter where I'm in

Her hair touch her ass, she gon' think she Korean

You fuckin' me good, bitch, you helpin' me win

Niggas can't see me, ain't no competition

Too many bracelets, need a whole 'nother wrist

I'm never sober, I think I'ma quit

I pop the E, I can feel when it kick



She bought a flight, nigga, can't even see me

Bitch break her neck just to look at the kid



Count up some millions and take some more drugs

Been stuck in my memory, they wasn't showing love

Ain't matching my fly, bitch, you know you a dub

I started this wave, and now use it as a brush

Stopped taking molly, I'm back on the E

Flying commercial, you ain't high as me

Driving a spaceship, the one with the wings

Cross up the trap, I done broke down a key

Ain't let no fuck nigga holdin' me back

Put a switch on it, these lil' niggas whack

After I hit your bitch, givin' her back

Ain't got no roof, put her heart on a strap

Go to the moon, ain't gon' show you no slatt

Pluto tycoon, ain't no regular 'Cat

Took a few shrooms, I forget where I'm at

Poppin' a Tesla, I feel when it kick

Girl you gone and done it to me
Harder than a hoochie-coochie
Got me like that first time
I heard Alan Jackson - Chattahoochee

I was never the same again

I'm a lifelong fan, yes I am



Baby, I love you like I love country music



You get me high as Willie girl, you get me gone as Jones

You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio

Let's take our time, walk the line kinda like

Johnny and June did, yeah let's do this

Baby, I love you like I love country music



'Cause I could never live without ya

Or my favorite songs about ya

Top-to-bottom perfect

You're like Brooks & Dunn's debut album

You got me feeling like

I'm a brand new man (oh, I'm a brand new man), yes I am



Baby, I love you like I love country music (yeah, I love country music)



You get me high as Willie girl, you get me gone as Jones

Baby, I love you like I love country music (hit 'em with it, woo)



If I was stranded on an island

Only way I could survive is

If I had you and that

Needle dropping on a vinyl



You get me high as Willie girl, you get me gone as Jones

You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio

Let's take our time, walk the line kinda like

Johnny and June did, yeah let's do this

Baby, I love you like I love country music

Oh baby, I love you like I love country music

Yeah, that's right



One, two, one two three, woo

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells rock

Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time

Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square

In the frosty air



What a bright time, it's the right time

To rock the night away

Jingle bell time is a swell time

To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh



Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet

Jingle around the clock

Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet

That's the jingle bell rock



Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells rock 

Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time

Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square

In the frosty air



What a bright time, it's the right time

To rock the night away

Jingle bell time is a swell time

To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh



Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet

Jingle around the clock

Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet

That's the jingle bell

That's the jingle bell

That's the jingle bell rock

--- 'Ojitos Lindos' by Bad Bunny and Bomba Estéreo ---
Hace mucho tiempo no le hago caso al corazón
Y pasan los día', los mese’ pensando en to' lo' (En to’ lo', en to' lo')
Ha llegado el tiempo para usar la razón
Antes que sea tarde y sin querer me parta en do' (Parta en do')
Antes de que salga el sol, pisa el acelerador

Aunque vaya sin freno' y pierda el control

Nada más'seremos do’, tú y yo acariciándono’

En medio del tiempo, sin decir adió'



Y solo mírame con esos ojito’ lindo'

Que con eso' yo también he vuеlto a nacer



Hace tiempo (Tiеmpo) que no agarro a nadie de la mano (Mano)

Hace tiempo (Tiempo) que no envío "buenos días, te amo" (Te amo)

Pero, tú me tienes enreda'o, me envolví

Iba por mi camino y me perdí (Ey, ey)

Mi mirada cambió cuando tus ojos vi (Tus ojos vi)

Bye-bye a los culo’, ni me despedí

Yo no te busqué, no, chocamo' en el trayecto

Con tu alma en la calle conecto (-necto)

Tranquila, no tiene que ser perfecto, no

Aquí no existe el pecado y equivocarse es bonito

Los errore' son placere', igual que to' tus besito'



Y solo mírame con esos ojito' lindo'

Que con eso' yo también he vuelto a nacer

Y solo mírame con esos ojito' lindo'

Que con eso' yo también he vuelto a nacer



Tú y yo, tú y yo, tú y yo

Tú y yo, tú y yo

Tú y yo, tú y yo, tú y yo

Tú y yo, tú y yo

Tú y yo, tú y yo

Tú y yo, tú y yo



Yo no me dejo llevar de nadie

Yo solo me dejo llevar de tu sonrisa

Y del lunar cerquita de tu boca

Si yo 'toy loco, tú estás loquita

Pero, baby, como tú no hay otra, no

Quiero regalarte girasole'

Ir pa' la playa y buscarte caracole'

Cuando estoy contigo, yo no miro el Role'

Vamo' a bailar doscientas cancione'

Nadie me pone como tú me pone' (Pone')

Mm-mmm, mm-mmm-mmm-mmm

Mm-mmm, mm-mmm-mmm-mmm

Yo le hablo a Dio' y tú ere' su respuesta

Aprendí que los momento' lindo' nunca cuestan

Como cuando me regalas tu mirada

Y el sol su puesta (Ey), y el sol su puesta (Ey)

Cuando estoy encima de ti, de ti

Mami, yo me olvido de to', de to'

No hace falta nadie aquí

Solamente tú y yo



Antes de que salga el sol, pisa el acelerador

Aunque vaya sin freno' y pierda el control

Nada más seremos do', tú y yo acariciándono'

En medio del tiempo, sin decir adió'



Y solo mírame con esos ojito' lindo'

Que con eso' yo también he vuelto a nacer

She likes it when I wear a suit
Pick her favorite movie

When she's talkin' to me
When I go get groceries
And I bring back flowers

And I rub her back

For like half an hour



Ooh oh oh

She likes it when I

Ooh oh oh



She likes it when I pour tequila

'Cause she knows that we about to

Have ourselves a little night

When I play John Denver

Through that little Bose speaker

And I start dimming those lights

And she knows by the way that I'm kissing on her

That we gon' take our time

She likes it when I

She likes it when I

She likes it when I mmm



When I leave a note

Make us reservations

Just because

That girl's worth celebrating

When I already know

What she's thinkin'

She don't have to say it yeah



She likes it when I pour tequila

'Cause she knows that we about to

Have ourselves a little night

When I play John Denver

When it comes to him, never again
Last time was the last time that time, nearly did us in
Yeah, too much drama
Girl, you're a match, you're gasoline
We just burn too fast

So here we are, lightin' up that spark

Yeah, we tried to run but we didn't get far



I never say never with you, I end up together with you

It's Hell and it's Heaven with you, baby

Anything's possible, the highs are unstoppable

It's so uncontrollable, it's crazy

We say we won't and then we do

You're all I want, I never say never with you



You got a touch that kills me, makes me feel alive

Couldn't turn me off, yeah, even if you tried

So keep turnin' me on and turn out the lights

Who knows tonight, we might get it right



I never say never with you, I end up together with you

It's Hell and it's Heaven with you, baby

Anything's possible, the highs are unstoppable

It's so uncontrollable, it's crazy

--- 'Damn Strait' by Scotty McCreery ---
Nobody In His Right Mind Would've Left Her
That was her favorite song
She sang along every time it came on
The first time we danced was to Marina Del Rey
And I fell right there and then

I didn’t want that song to end



Baby Blue was the color of her eyes

I can still see them in my mind

Probably will for the rest of my life



Damn Strait, you’re killing me man

You know I’ve always been your biggest fan

Now I can’t even listen

‘Cause I’ll get to missin’ her

Then thehurt gets worse



Damn Strait, I used to love your songs

But now every time that one comes on

My heart gets broke in half

But do I wish I could get her back?

Damn Strait



The other day right out of a Blue Clear Sky

You came on in my truck

I couldn’t turn it off fast enough

I tried to get back in the game

But this ole heart just ain’t the same

Hell I can’t even Give It Away

Damn Strait, you’re killing me man

You know I’ve always been your biggest fan

Now I can’t even listen

‘Cause I’ll get to missin’ her

Then the hurt gets worse



Damn Strait, I used to love your songs

But now every time that one comes on

My heart gets broke in half

But do I wish I could get her back?

Damn Strait



I know it ain’t your fault

That she left me

And you know you’ll always be the king

But right now I Hate Everything



Damn Strait, you’re killing me man

You know I’ve always been your biggest fan

Now I can’t even listen

‘Cause I’ll get to missin’ her

Then the hurt gets worse



Damn Strait, I used to love your songs

But now every time that one comes on

My heart gets broke in half

But do I wish I could get her back?

Damn Strait

Damn Strait

Nobody In His Right Mind Would've Left Her

That was her favorite song

She sang along every time it came on

--- 'She's All I Wanna Be' by Tate McRae ---
You want a girl with the small waist
And the perfect smile
Someone who's out every week day
In her dad's new car
You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say "It's not that hard"

But I just got a feeling

This will leave an ugly scar



If you say, "She's nothing to worry about"

Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?



Stupid boy making me so sad

Didn't think you could change this fast

She's got everythin' that I don't have

How could I ever compete with that?

I know you'll go and change your mind

One day wake up and you're bored with mine

She's got everything that I don't have

And shе's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad

She's got еverything that I don't have

Mhm



You want someone you can show off

Whenever you go out

To wear a tight mini black dress

With all her friends around

And then you'll probably spend the night at

Her nice big house

And by then I'll just be standing

You've forgotten about, oh



If you say, "She's nothing to worry about"

Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?



Stupid boy making me so sad

Didn't think you could change this fast

She's got everythin' that I don't have

How could I ever compete with that?

I know you'll go and change your mind

One day wake up and you're bored with mine

She's got everything that I don't have

And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad

She's got everything that I don't have

And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be



Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

She's all I wanna be so bad, oh

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Uh, uh



Stupid boy making me so sad

Didn't think you would hurt this bad

She's got everythin' that I don't have

How could I ever compete with that?

I know you'll go and change your mind

One day wake up and you're bored with mine

She's got everything that I don't have

And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad

All I wanna be so bad (So bad)

She's got everything that I don't have (So bad)

And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad

--- 'Last Night Lonely' by Jon Pardi ---
Yeah, this could be your last drink from a stranger in a bar
The last time that you're dancing in unfamiliar arms
Yeah, this could be your last first kiss, if we do this thing right
Your last time alone beneath neon lights
It could be your last night coming in here, drinking all by yourself

The last time giving your heart away to someone else

Yeah, we could be some history in the making girl, tonight

Might be your last night lonely



Yeah, you could be the last first name that's ever been worth asking

Yeah, you could be the last phone number I write down on a napkin

Yeah, you could be the last girl that I take back home to Mama

The last time that we're talked about in this small-town drama



It's gonna be the last night coming in here, drinking all by yourself

The last time giving your heart away to someone else

Yeah, we could be some history in the making girl, tonight

Might be your last night lonely

It could be your last night lonely



It could be your last night coming in here, drinking all by yourself

The last time giving your heart away to someone else

Yeah, we could be some history in the making girl, tonight

Might be your last night lonely



It could be your last night coming in here, drinking all by yourself

The last time giving your heart away to someone else

Yeah, we could be some history in the making girl, tonight

Might be your last night lonely

It could be your last night lonely, yeah

Last night lonely, baby

--- 'Flower Shops' by Ernest featuring Morgan Wallen ---
It's a beautiful day she's been crying all night
Oh, there's tears in her blue and bloodshot in mine
This bender's been bending, it's hellbound to break
My baby's had all she can take
Mister, I'll take your roses

If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more

I'll buy violets and daisies to hide all the crazy, it's gonna take all you've got

Oh, it's a bad day for love but a good day for flower shops



Well, I took some pills and she took the dogs

Oh, it's all gone to hell she's gone to her mom's

And I took up drinking since she took the time

To tell me I took the best years of her life



So, buddy, I'll take your roses

If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more

I'll buy violets and daisies to hide all the crazy, it's gonna take all you've got

It's a tough day for love but a good day for flower shops



Roses are red

Violets are blue

I don't need one, I need one million to...

Get you



So mister, I'll take all your roses

If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more

I'll buy violets and daisies to get back my baby, it's gonna take all you got

Oh, it's a bad day for love but a good day for flower shops

--- 'One Mississippi' by Kane Brown ---
You and I
Had this off and on so long
You've been here then you've been gone
So many times
And every night
Yeah, I'm always bumpin' into you

We do the same things we used to

It's your place or it's mine so



Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Five minutes out of downtown

Ain't nothin' but a countdown



One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey

Are you on your way?

Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait

Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'

We'll be on our way

So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever



Mm, every time I'm at this bar, tap on the shoulder, turn around

And baby, there you are

And it's fire, you're like this Bourbon, hundred proof

Yeah, they don't burn the way you do

Yeah, we're better in the dark so



Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Five minutes out of downtown

Ain't nothin' but a countdown



One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey

Are you on your way?

Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait

Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'

We'll be on our way

So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever





Hey



Kinda like that Georgia wind

We'll be gone and back again

But always wind up right back where we are

Playin' roulette with our hearts

And blowin' smoke rings in the dark, yeah



Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Five minutes out of downtown

Ain't nothin' but a countdown



One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey

Are you on your way?

Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait

Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'

We'll be on our way

So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever



Every time I'm at this bar, tap on the shoulder, turn around

And baby, there you are

--- 'Circles Around This Town' by Maren Morris ---
I swear I don't know how I trusted
A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tennessee
I showed up to the new apartment

First month's, last month's, two deposits

Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet

Thank God I was an optimist



I drove circles around this town

Trying to write circles around this town

Trying to say something with meaning, something worth singing about

I've been kind and I've been ruthless

Yeah, I got here but the truth is

Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different

But I still got the pedal down

Driving circles around this town



So many times I thought about leaving

Got my ass kicked trying to compete with

Everybody else's ones that got away

Hung around long enough to catch a break



Couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked

Was the one about a car and the one about a church

That I wrote



Driving circles around this town

Trying to write circles around this town

Trying to say something with meaning, something worth singing about

I've been kind and I've been ruthless

Yeah, I got here but the truth is

Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different

But I still got the pedal down

Driving circles around this town

Driving circles around this town



I drove circles around this town

Trying to write circles around this town

Trying to say something with meaning, something worth singing about

I've been kind and I've been ruthless

Yeah, I got here but the truth is

Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different

But I still got the pedal down

I still get lost, I still get found

Driving circles around this town

Oh, yeah
