--- Blank Space by Taylor Swift ---
Nice to meet you
Where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sins
Saw you there and I thought oh my god
Look at that face, you look like my next mistake

Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie

I can read you like a magazine

Ain't it funny rumors fly

And I know you heard about me

So hey, let's be friends

I'm dying to see how this one ends

Grab your passport and my hand

I can make the bad guys good for a weekend



So it's gonna be forever

Or it's gonna go down in flames

You can tell me when it's over

If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane

Cause you know I love the players

And you love the game



Cause we're young and we're reckless

We'll take this way too far, It'll leave you breathless

Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane

But I've got a blank space baby

And I'll write your name



Cherry lips

Crystal skies

I could show you incredible things

Stolen kisses, pretty lies 

You're the king baby I'm your queen

Find out what you want

Be that girl for a month

Wait, the worst is yet to come

Oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms

I can make all the tables turn

Rose garden filled with thorns

Keep you second guessing like, oh my god

Who is she? I get drunk on jealousy

But you'll come back each time you leave

Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream



So it's gonna be forever

Or it's gonna go down in flames

You can tell me when it's over

If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane

Cause you know I love the players

And you love the game



Cause we're young and we're reckless

We'll take this way too far, It'll leave you breathless

Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane

But I've got a blank space baby

And I'll write your name



Boys only want love

If it's torture

Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn you

Boys only want love, If it's torture

Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn you



So it's gonna be forever

Or it's gonna go down in flames

You can tell me when it's over

If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane

Cause you know I love the players

And you love the game



Cause we're young and we're reckless

We'll take this way too far, It'll leave you breathless

Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane

But I've got a blank space baby

And I'll write your name

--- Shape of You by Ed Sheeran ---
The club isn't the best place to find a lover so the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me 
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox

And then we start to dance and now I'm singing like



Girl, you know I want your love

Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Come on now, follow my lead

I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now, follow my lead

Come, come on now, follow my lead



I'm in love with the shape of you

We push and pull like a magnet do

Although my heart is falling too

I'm in love with your body

And last night you were in my room

And now my bedsheets smell like you

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with the shape of you



One week in we let the story begin, we're going out on our first date

You and me are thrifty so go all you can eat

Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour

And how your family is doing okay

Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat

Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singing like



Girl, you know I want your love

Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Come on now, follow my lead

I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now, follow my lead

Come, come on now, follow my lead



I'm in love with the shape of you

We push and pull like a magnet do

Although my heart is falling too

I'm in love with your body

And last night you were in my room

And now my bedsheets smell like you

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with the shape of you



Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on



I'm in love with the shape of you

We push and pull like a magnet do

Although my heart is falling too

I'm in love with your body

Last night you were in my room

And now my bedsheets smell like you

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with your body



Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with the shape of you

--- Roar by Katy Perry ---
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything



You held me down, but I got up

Already brushing off the dust

You hear my voice, you hear that sound

Like thunder, gonna shake the ground

You held me down, but I got up

Get ready cause I've had enough

I see it all, I see it now



I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire

Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR

Louder, louder than a lion

Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You're gonna hear me roar



Now I'm floating like a butterfly

Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes

I went from zero, to my own hero



You held me down, but I got up

Already brushing off the dust

You hear my voice, you hear that sound

Like thunder, gonna shake the ground

You held me down, but I got up

Get ready 'cause I've had enough

I see it all, I see it now



I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire

Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR

Louder, louder than a lion

Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You're gonna hear me roar

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You'll hear me ROAR

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You're gonna hear me ROAR



Roar-or, roar-or, roar-or, roar-or, roar-or



I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire

Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR

Louder, louder than a lion

Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You're gonna hear me ROAR

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You'll hear me ROAR

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You're gonna hear me ROAR

--- Umbrella by Rihanna ---
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather

And G5's are better

You know me

In anticipation for precipitation

Stack chips for the rainy day

JayRain Man is back

With little Ms. Sunshine

Rihanna, where you at?



You have my heart

And we'll never be worlds apart

May be in magazines

But you'll still be my star

Baby, cause in the dark

You can't see shiny cars

And that's when you need me there

With you I'll always share

Because



When the sun shine, we shine together

Told you I'll be here forever

Said I'll always be your friend

Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever

Know that we'll still have each other

You can stand under my umbrella

You can stand under my umbrella

(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

Under my umbrella

(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)



These fancy things

Will never come in between

You're part of my entity

Here for infinity

When the war has took its part

When the world has dealt its cards

If the hand is hard

Together we'll mend your heart

Because



When the sun shine, we shine together

Told you I'll be here forever

Said I'll always be your friend

Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever

Know that we'll still have each other

You can stand under my umbrella

You can stand under my umbrella

(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

Under my umbrella

(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)



You can run into my arms

It's okay; don't be alarmed

Come into me

There's no distance in between our love

So go on and let the rain pour

I'll be all you need and more

Because



When the sun shine, we shine together

Told you I'll be here forever

Said I'll always be your friend

Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever

Know that we'll still have each other

You can stand under my umbrella

You can stand under my umbrella

(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

Under my umbrella

(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)



It's rainin', rainin'

Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'

Baby, come here to me

Come into me

It's rainin', rainin'

Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'

You can always come into me

Come into me

It's pourin' rain

It's pourin' rain

Come here to me

Come into me ...

--- Sorry by Justin Bieber ---
Oooh, ooh...
Oooh, ooh...
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?

'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness



I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice

By once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times

So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight

'Cause I just need one more shot at second chance



Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh... Sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh.. Sorry

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... 



I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to

But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two

I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth

Can we both say the words and forget this? Yeah



Is it too late now to say sorry?

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



I'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh no no)

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?





Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh... Sorry, oh

Ooh, ooh... Sorry

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh... Sorry, oh

Ooh, ooh... Sorry

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
