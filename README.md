# Lyrics Scraper

> This repository allows you to scrape songs in lyrics.ovh and store them in a text file.

The LyricsGenius API is no longer workable. See https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius/issues/220. So LyricsGenius is deprecated.

## Usage

- Add the names of the pop songs you wish to grab lyrics for in the `POP_SONGS` array
- Run `python lyricScraper.py` in your terminal
- Sit back and relax
- Boom! You will have the lyrics stored in the `data/lyrics_ovh.txt`
